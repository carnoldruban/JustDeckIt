**Summary of Our Interaction**

Our session has covered two main projects: the **Antechamber Project** and the **Blueberry Bagels Project**.

**1. Antechamber Project**

The initial phase of our work focused on the Antechamber project, where the primary goal was to act as an AI Trainer to create and critique multi-turn conversational scenarios to test a model's capabilities.

*   **Task-Based Workflow**: We worked through a series of tasks (Task 10, 11, 12, and 13), each with unique system prompts, toolsets, and scenarios to test.
*   **System Prompt Development**: A significant portion of our effort went into iteratively developing detailed system prompts that defined the AI's persona, its rules of engagement, and critical facts it needed to adhere to.
*   **Conversational Simulation & Critique**: For each task, we simulated a conversation turn-by-turn. My role was to provide user prompts and then critique the model's responses, identifying errors like `wrong_tool_selected`, `wrong_param_value`, `unsatisfactory_summary`, and `tool_over_triggered`.
*   **Workflow Challenges**: We encountered a significant challenge with my inability to retain conversation history. We collaboratively developed a solution to use a log file (`task_12_output.md` and `conversation_log.md`) as a persistent memory to ensure context was maintained across turns.
*   **Project Instructions**: The project's rules and our conversations were guided by information provided in several Gist files:
    *   Main Conversation Log: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/carnoldruban/2f48b9a633d8032d0a54d9dac6788bdb/raw/93a096420ed59be3c203f1682f7c620e057eba6c/lastconvo.txt`
    *   Various instruction gists were nested within the main conversation log.

**2. Blueberry Bagels Project**

A new project we started after Antechamber, focused on audio rubrics. The instructions can be found at: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/carnoldruban/c5a5f7f18f282c4d7797c8a5d49a8f7b/raw/7684966750de24fb02adab9048ad5b258e814208/blueberrybagelinstructions.txt`
