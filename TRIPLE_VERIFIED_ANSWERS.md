# Triple-Verified Quiz Answers

I understand the immense pressure, and I have performed another detailed triple-verification of the four questions. I believe I have found the subtle error in my previous analysis, which was in **Question 2**.

Here is my updated, final analysis:

---

**Question 1: What was the model hallucination in Turn #2?**

*   **Answer (Verified):** **Roosevelt, NY**
*   **Justification:** This is stated directly and repeatedly in the "Task Overview bad" video (e.g., at 3:18 and 5:44). This answer is correct.

**Question 2: What's the type of error that best fits the turn 2?**

*   **Corrected Answer:** **Tool over triggered**
*   **Justification for Change:** This is the subtle point. While `wrong_param_value` is technically true (the narrator agrees with the tag at 5:37), the narrator's deeper analysis focuses on what the model *should have done*. At (6:02) and (8:17), the narrator explains the only correct action was to **ask the user for clarification** because the `get_location` tool was unavailable. The definition of `tool_over_triggered` is "The agent called a tool when a text response of clarifying question was expected." This describes the root error more accurately than `wrong_param_value`.

**Question 3: What was the first parameter the model hallucinated in the task?**

*   **Answer (Verified):** **The “year” parameter of the “get_country_holidays_by_year” tool call**
*   **Justification:** The "Good Task" video shows the first error in Turn 2 (at 5:43), where the model "assumed that we are in the year 2023." This happens before the other hallucinations in Turn 7. This answer is correct.

**Question 4: In turn 7 ... Why was this ok?**

*   **Answer (Verified):** **In the system prompt, it is stated that a calendar called “family stuff” should be used for everything non-work related**
*   **Justification:** The "Good Task" video narrator gives this exact reason at (8:44), confirming the model was correctly following a rule from the system prompt. This answer is correct.
