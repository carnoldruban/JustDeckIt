### Justification of Model Failures

Here is a breakdown of the significant failures found in the `simulated_failed_response.md` file:

1.  **Failure to Follow Instructions: Incorrect Data Join and Analysis**
    *   **Location of Error:** Part 2: Socio-Economic Charging Behavior Analysis.
    *   **Explanation:** The prompt explicitly asks for an analysis based on the **customer's** `income_tier` (from `customers.csv`). The model incorrectly joins the data based on the **charging station's district** `income_tier` (from `charging_stations.csv`). This is a fundamental misinterpretation of the request and demonstrates a failure to correctly join and analyze data from multiple sources as instructed.

2.  **Failure to Complete the Task: Missing Section**
    *   **Location of Error:** The entire response.
    *   **Explanation:** The model completely omitted Part 3 of the prompt ("Battery Efficiency vs. Charging Cost"). This is a significant failure, as it ignored a major part of the analysis, including the calculation of a derived metric and the creation of a required visualization.

3.  **Failure in Reasoning: Vague and Non-Data-Driven Recommendation**
    *   **Location of Error:** Part 4: Strategic Recommendation.
    *   **Explanation:** The prompt requires a specific, data-driven recommendation on whether to partner with or compete against the dominant operator in high-income districts. The model's response ("focus on improving customer service") is generic, not supported by the preceding analysis, and completely fails to address the strategic question asked. This indicates a failure in high-level reasoning and synthesizing information.
