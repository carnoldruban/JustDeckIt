### Foundation Dry Run Analysis

**Objective:** To verify the end-to-end functionality of the current foundation application (`tracker_app.py` and `scraper.py`).

---

### 1. Startup and UI Initialization
**Action:** User runs `python tracker_app.py`.
**Expected Outcome:**
*   The main application window appears.
*   The UI is created by the `create_widgets` method. It correctly displays the top control bar, the shoe controls (with a dropdown including 'None'), and the info panels for Card Counting, Strategy, and ML Prediction.
*   The main text area for the 'Live Game Feed' is visible.
*   **Verification:** The application should start without any syntax or import errors.

### 2. Live Tracking and Data Flow
**Action:** User clicks 'Start Tracking'.
**Expected Outcome:**
1.  **Scraper Activation:** The `start_tracking` method correctly creates a `Scraper` instance and starts it in a background thread.
2.  **Data Acquisition:** The scraper connects to the browser, finds the game iframe, and begins listening for console log messages.
3.  **Queue Population:** When a game data object is found, the scraper correctly serializes it to a JSON string and puts the full data object onto the `data_queue`.
4.  **UI Processing (`process_queues`):**
    *   The loop dequeues the data object.
    *   It extracts the `payloadData`.
    *   It calls `format_game_state` with the payload.
    *   **Crucially, it correctly updates the main display area with the formatted round-wise string.** It will insert a new line for a new `gameId` and update the existing line for an existing `gameId`.
5.  **Non-Functional Components:**
    *   The `update_stats_and_strategy` method is called, but since the `shoe_manager` is a placeholder and the card counting logic is not fully integrated, the 'Card Counting' and 'Strategy Assistant' panels will show their default values but will not update with meaningful data. **This is the expected behavior for the foundation.**

---
**Conclusion:** The foundation is solid. The core data pipeline from scraper to the round-wise UI display is functional. The application is stable and ready to have the advanced feature logic (shuffling, zones, real card counting) built on top of it.
