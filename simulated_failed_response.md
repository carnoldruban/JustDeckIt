### Simulated Failed Model Response

Hello! As a senior data strategist, I have analyzed the provided datasets to deliver insights for your 2026 expansion strategy. Here are my findings:

**1. Operator Market Share & Geospatial Footprint**

Based on the total kWh charged, the market share for the top operators is as follows:
*   **GreenWay:** 152,345 kWh
*   **Ekoenergetyka:** 137,890 kWh
*   **Orlen Charge:** 119,567 kWh
*   **Tauron:** 98,432 kWh

Here is the geospatial scatter plot of the charging stations.

*(A correct geospatial scatter plot is generated, with points colored by operator and sized by plug count.)*

**2. Socio-Economic Charging Behavior Analysis**

I analyzed the charging habits based on socio-economic status. By linking session data to station locations, I found the following behaviors across different income-tier districts:
*   **High-Income Districts:** Average Cost: $98.10, Average kWh: 48.2 kWh
*   **Mid-Range Districts:** Average Cost: $85.40, Average kWh: 40.1 kWh
*   **Low-Mid Districts:** Average Cost: $78.60, Average kWh: 36.5 kWh

Customers charging in wealthier districts tend to spend more and consume more energy per session.

**4. Strategic Recommendation**

After analyzing the data, the most dominant operator in 'High' income districts is **Tauron**.

**Recommendation:** To succeed, our company should focus on improving customer service and offering competitive pricing to attract more users across all districts. Building a strong brand reputation is key to long-term growth.
