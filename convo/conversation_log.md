edit?tab=t.micufeljkcon -- > This includfes instructions what to do what not to
do and examples NOTE: In Ballerina Capuchina we try to avoid writing rubrics wit
h negative logic such as “Does the code avoid.“ However, there are some edge cas
es like this one where that might be necessary: Here the prompt is explicitly re
questing not to complete the implementation of ToSlackMessage at this stage, and
 there should be a rubric item to check for that.

I have accessed and reviewed the document. I'm ready for the next steps.

Ballerina Capuchina Intro In this introduction, you will get an overview of what
 a good task in Ballerina Capuchina looks like. The purpose of this project is t
o generate Cursor Questions and rubrics for LLM responses that will help AI agen
ts solve SWE problems.

Understood. I'm familiar with the concept of generating Cursor Questions and rub
rics for LLM responses to aid AI agents in solving software engineering problems
. I'm ready to proceed.

On the Ballerina Capuchina Knowledge Check If you have completed this onboarding
 in the past, you will have to retake it as a new set of questions has been adde
d to assess full understanding of the content of this onboarding.

You will need a score of 80% to complete it successfully.

Okay, I understand the requirement of retaking the onboarding and the passing sc
ore. I'm ready for the knowledge check.

Goal of this project

Welcome to the Ballerina Capuchina Onboarding!

In this introduction, you'll learn how to create questions out of GitHub PRs and
 create rubrics to assess the quality of LLM-generated responses.

This will help us train LLMs to s

I understand the goal is to create questions from GitHub PRs and rubrics to asse
ss LLM-generated responses, ultimately to train LLMs. I'm ready to learn more.

What Do You Have to Deliver?

These are the task fields that will be delivered to the customer. They will give
 the prompt to an LLM, and then grade the LLM's response based on the rubrics yo
u submit.

Question (1) : A prompt/question that helps the model extract relevant backgroun
d information or clarify technical details related to the codebase or the PR. Th
is input will be used as the initial user prompt during model training, so it sh
ould invite the model to explore the why, how, or impact of the changes, rather
than jump into implementation.

Reference Answer (1) : Use Claude Sonnet 3.7 or Claude Sonnet 4 in Cursor to gen
erate a high-quality sample response to your question. This answer should demons
trate what a good LLM output would look like when responding to your prompt.

Rubrics by question: A list of at least 10 yes/no questions to assess the model'
s response to your prompt. The reference answer should FAIL at least 60% of thes
e. Each rubric item should be:

Objective (answerable as yes or no),

Atomic (each question checks one thing),

Self-contained (understandable without extra context),

Focused on clarity, completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the model’s answer
to your context-seeking question.

The rubrics will be used to check an ideal model response. This response should
have the expected information/code changes.

The items in the rubric can be evaluated as true or false for any given response
 to the prompt. If you follow each item in the checklist, you can write an ideal
 response.

Mapping of Rubrics to the Supporting Context: You need to map each rubric to a j
ustification as to why that rubric item needs to be included in the Rubrics list
. This can be code that is present in the repository, prompt requirements, or mo
re conceptual justifications for the inclusion of the rubric.

I understand the deliverables: a Question, a Reference Answer, Rubrics by questi
on (at least 10, with specific criteria and a 60% failure rate for the reference
 answer), and Mapping of Rubrics to the Supporting Context. I'm ready for the ne
xt part.

Writing a Cursor Question

In this section, write one question you may ask Cursor to help you understand a
specific topic related to the repository. The questions can be related to the re
pository or the issues/modules/functions mentioned in the GitHub issue / PR, but
 the questions SHOULD NOT mention the PR or the commit.

The goal is to ask hard questions that will stump the model. That is, questions
that the model is not able to provide a full answer to.

Check the How to Write Good Questions and Question Styles and Diversity sections
 for more guidance.

You can use the PR commit messages (if any) and the comments in the code to help
 you identify different modules/functionalities you may ask Cursor about.

Do not copy the exact examples from the GitHub Issue Descriptions when providing
 code-replication snippets in your questions.

Use Cursor to help you understand the code: Ask for code explanations proving co
ntext of the files (use @file_name and line numbers to provide context to the ag
ent).

If your question references files: add the full path in the “Write the full path
 file” field. If your prompt doesn’t mention any files, write N/A

Okay, I understand the requirements for writing a Cursor Question. The key is to
 ask challenging questions that the model struggles with, focusing on understand
ing repository topics without directly mentioning the PR or commit. I'll use the
 provided guidance and tools like Cursor for context. I also note the instructio
n about specifying file paths or 'N/A'.

How to Write Good Questions These are questions that will help a developer get m
ore context on the repository you are working with. The questions should mirror
how you’d use LLMs in your everyday usage when coding. Try to follow this advice
:

Start a new conversation in Cursor in the AGENT mode when you want to get the gr
ound truth/reference answer for the task.

Key Guidelines for Question Writing: The questions should be written in casual a
nd natural language. Avoid overly formal or flowery language, as we are recreati
ng what a developer would normally ask. Ask hard questions that will stump the m
odel. That is, questions that Claude 3.7 Sonnet is not able to provide a full an
swer to. Harder questions rely on data from multiple parts of the codebase that
require the agent to synthesize knowledge from multiple files, especially how mu
ltiple files interact. Harder questions do not mean asking several questions sim
ultaneously. The project’s focus is One Question -> One Answer. Avoid bundling s
everal questions together in one prompt.

Other Important Guidelines: Focus on different criteria related to the repositor
y and the code functionalities in the code source files. Check the Question Styl
es and Diversity section for different types of questions you may ask in differe
nt tasks. The questions should be about the code in the repository. For example,
 if you’re working on the Pandas repository, you should ask about the implementa
tion of Pandas as if you were a developer working on the Pandas implementation,
not something like “how do I create a DataFrame in Pandas” The questions SHOULD
NOT mention any content from the solution in the PR or the commit. The questions
 are about the repository. The PR is there just to help you diversify the questi
ons you make, so you can focus on different files and functionalities. The quest
ions need to be realistic (NO FANCY FORMATTING such as markdown). Avoid backtick
s and markdown, such as ###, in the questions. Don’t just copy the question exam
ples as templates. Be creative. Use casual language. Don’t be formal. Avoid writ
ing questions that look like GitHub issue descriptions: Think about what a devel
oper may ask a coding agent when using a repository. If your task has an issue d
escription with replication code, you can use that as INSPIRATION for the files
and modules you may want to mention in your question. Be precise: Try to match t
he level of precision you’d normally provide when prompting an LLM, but do not l
eak the PR solution if you are using the PR as inspiration! For debugging-type o
f questions, describe or mention the relevant existing code or functionality if
needed: The questions should include the relevant information for the Agent to a
ddress the problem. Reference relevant files: Reference other files by using the
 @file_name convention in Cursor that provides that file as context.

Example questions:

["performance_question"] What is the impact of replacing the in-memory update lo
gic with a persistent traversal-based index updater in the keyValueIndexed datab
ase on the consistency, performance and modularity of the OrbitDB system? ["debu
gging_question"] I am seeing a noticeable delay when expanding the suggested lis
t, where the chat bubbles in the messageContainer adjust their position too late
. Can you help me identify what part of the layout update in messageContainer mi
ght be causing this lag, and tell me how to synchronize the layout changes? ["im
plementation_details"] Can you explain how jobs are defined and configured in @j
ob_config.py as well as what other configuration options are available?

Question Styles and Diversity:

The questions you submit should be diverse in style and content. Use the followi
ng list as inspiration, as you might find more different styles of questions rel
ated to your PR problem that you can ask Cursor.

Type of Question Explanation Example Questions on Implementation Details & Inter
nal APIs: These focus on understanding how specific code components work or prod
uce results within the context of the problem.

Ask about how specific classes, methods, or modules in the repo are implemented
or intended to be used. May involve describing function signatures, clarifying i
nput/output Example Question: "Can you explain the logic flow within the process
_data function in @data_utils.py, and describe how it transforms the input data
based on the parameters, especially in relation to how its output is utilized or
 further processed in @model_pipeline.py?"

Example Question: "How should I correctly instantiate and use the ConfigurationM
anager class to access the database connection string needed for this feature, a
nd how does this approach align with the initialization and usage patterns obser
ved in both @config_loader.py and @database_client.py elsewhere in the repositor
y?” Debugging/Troubleshooting Questions: These focus on diagnosing issues or und
erstanding unexpected behavior related to a problem. The answer to these questio
ns should explain or guide a troubleshooting process for errors found in the rep
o, including reading logs, stack traces, or error messages.

You can ask about verification checks for thoroughness in root cause analysis an
d clarity in describing how the repository’s codebase might produce or handle sp
ecific errors.

Example Question: "I get a KeyError: 'user_id' when processing the exported data
. Can you identify where this error is occurring and fix it? It seems like the i
ssue might be in@data_parser.py and @data_validator.py. I need to make sure the
data handling is robust,fault-tolerant and still in line with the repository’s p
ractices." Code Structure/ Design Questions These focus on understanding the org
anization, relationships, or overall structure of the codebase relevant to the p
roblem. The answers to these questions should provide high-level explanations ab
out how the repo’s modules, services, or data layers are structured, why they ar
e designed that way, or how various components interact.

Example Question: "Describe the relationship between the User model, the Authent
icationService, and the LoginHandler within this project structure, particularly
 as they relate to the user login issue mentioned." Questions on Best Practices
and Patterns: They aim to get recommendations for coding standards, design patte
rns, or library usage within the context of the repo’s language, frameworks, or
domain.

Example Question: “What are the design patterns that organize service logic acro
ss @api_routes.py and @service_layer.py to keep the separation of concerns and a
llow scalability within the framework used in the repository?

Performance & Scalability Questions Offer conceptual and code-level advice on op
timizing and scaling the repo’s implementation. Verification checks the alignmen
t of suggestions with known performance patterns (e.g., caching, load balancing)
 and correctness in referencing relevant parts of the provided code. Example Que
stion: What is the impact of replacing the in-memory update logic with a persist
ent traversal-based index updater in the keyValueIndexed database on the consist
ency, performance and modularity of the OrbitDB system? Refactoring/Improvement
Questions: These focus on asking the AI for suggestions on improving existing co
de relevant to the problem. Another way to use the AI to "help you solve the pro
blem", focusing on improving the code quality, efficiency, or maintainability in
 the area affected by the problem statement.

Example Question: "Can you suggest ways to refactor the redundant code blocks fo
und in ModuleA.py and ModuleB.py that handle similar data validation logic, maki
ng it more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?"

How to Collect Model Answers from Cursor The answers you write are the reference
 you will use for your rubrics in the next step. These answers should include al
l the relevant information to provide a perfect answer to your question.

Write your question in Cursor and select Claude Sonnet 3.7 in AGENT mode. Submit
 the question. Copy the answer in the task. Remember to include the code snippet
s. Sometimes when copying directly from Cursor, the code doesn’t get copied. Use
 the answer as a base guide for the classification of your rubrics.

The information in the answers may come internally, from the repository, or exte
rnally, for example, when asking about best practices and design patterns.

I've reviewed the detailed guidelines on writing good Cursor questions and colle
cting model answers. I understand the emphasis on asking hard, natural language
questions that require the model to synthesize information from multiple parts o
f the codebase, without mentioning the PR or commit directly. I also understand
the different question styles and the process for obtaining reference answers us

Cursor SWE Agent Problem Reviewing Rubric Reviewers use this rubric to evaluate
responses. Any task scoring a 1-2 on any category will be SBQ’d, and they should
 be approved. Your overall rating of a task should be based on the lowest catego
ry score a task receives.

Please also refer to the Common Errors section for common issues that warrant a
task failure. Deliverable Categories

When evaluating task quality, reviewers will evaluate the quality of two problem
 deliverables plus the overall structure of the broader GitHub issue/PR the cont
ributor is decomposing:

Prompt Reviewers will evaluate the quality of the input prompts the user writes
to ensure they are providing sufficient detail and solving the correct problem.
Rubrics Reviewers will evaluate the thoroughness and specificity of the rubrics,
 ensuring that they follow the rubrics' best practices and that there is no over
lap between the different criteria. Note that the code and prompt rubric should
be considered as one whole

Evaluation Rubric

Type Field 1-2 (Fail) 3 (Okay) 4-5 (Good/ Perfect) Explanation Question Primary
Category Prompt Question Category selected is incorrect N/A Question Category se
lected is appropriate

Naturalness (Prompt) Prompt The prompt is unreasonable and is highly unlikely to
 be asked by a SWE using Cursor in the real world N/A Prompt feels natural; coul
d be reasonably asked by a SWE working on a problem Prompts should ask reasonabl
e questions that a SWE working on a project might ask to help them better unders
tand the repo or problem. If the prompt feels overly contrived or like something
 that Self Contained & Solvable (Prompt) Prompt The prompt requires external inf
ormation to solve N/A The prompt is self contained and can be answered without r
eferencing external sources All information needed to solve the prompt should be
 contained within the repo or should be reasonable context for an LLM to know.

A prompt should not require internet search or reference of external sources to
answer the question Correctness (File Mapping) Prompt The file mapping contains
at least one error N/A The file mapping is correct The file mapping maps the fil
es referenced in the prompt (e.g., @foo.py) to the full file path (e.g., package
s/modules/foo.py) Classification Correctness Rubric 2 or more rubrics are not co
rrectly classified, or any rubric labeled as a critical failure is not actually
a critical failure 1 rubric item is not correctly classified All rubric items ar
e correctly classified Every rubric is labeled according to whether it is critic
al (must have) or non-critical (nice to have). The Claude Sonnet response is the
n evaluated against the rubric to determine if the response passes or fails the
rubric. Your job is to evaluate whether the rubrics are correctly classified alo
ng these axes. Completeness Rubric Rubric misses any critical items that a good
response must include N/A Rubric is fully complete and provides a good means of
assessing a good response to the prompt. All potential critical items are captur
ed. Consider all the elements you would want to include to create a perfect resp
onse and put them into the rubric. This means including not only the facts and s
tatements directly requested by the prompt, but also the supporting details that
 provide justification, reasoning, and logic for your response. Each of these el
ements should have a criterion because each criterion helps to develop the answe
r to the question from a slightly different angle. No Overlapping Rubric There a
re 3 or more pairs of rubric items that overlap with each other There are 1-2 pa
irs of rubric items that assess overlapping areas No rubric items overlap The sa
me error from a model shouldn’t be punished multiple times. Difficulty - Overall
 Rubric Rubric items are very easy and it 80%+ of the rubric items are passed by
 the model Rubric items are somewhat difficult and reference solution passes 60-
80% of rubric items

Rubric includes many difficult/aspirational items and the reference solution pas
ses under 60% of rubric items A good rule of thumb is that the model fails on 50
% of rubrics items, otherwise the task might be too easy. Good rubrics should in
clude “aspirational” items that current best models do not include Difficulty -
Critical Failures Rubric

There are no critical rubric items where the reference solution fails

There is one critical rubric item where the reference answer fails There are two
 or more critical rubric items where the reference answer fails CBs must classif
y each rubric by whether the reference answer passes or fails on it and whether
the rubric is critical or “nice to have” for a good response. A passing rubric m
ust have at least one critical failure.

Difficulty - Critical Failures Mis labeling Rubric If a CB labels a rubric as
“critical failure” but it should be non-critical, this is also an auto fail. N/A
 Critical Failure is labeled correctly

Atomicity Rubric 2+ rubric items or any critical items are not atomic 1 rubric i
tem is not atomic All rubric items are atomic Each rubric criterion should evalu
ate exactly one distinct aspect. Avoid bundling multiple criteria into a single
rubric. Most stacked criteria with the word “and” can be broken up into multiple
 pieces. Specificity Rubric 2+ rubric items or any critical rubric items are not
 specific 1 rubric item is not atomic All rubric items are objectively true/fals
e Criteria should be binary (true or false) and objective. Self Contained Rubric
 2+ rubric items or any critical rubric items are not self contained 1 rubric it
em is not self-contained All rubric items are self-contained Each criterion shou
ld contain all the information needed to evaluate a response, e.g. ❌ Mentions th
e capital city of Canada. ✅ Mentions the capital city of Canada is Ottawa.

Criterion should be verifiable without requiring external search.

Without having to search externally we should be able to answer the rubric quest
ion

Diversity Rubric The rubric items are highly repetitive with less than 3 distinc
t categories overall

Rubric items are moderately diverse but have some repetition. There are at least
 three distinct “types” of rubric items Rubric items are diverse and assess resp
onses across a variety of areas The rubric items should include variable types o
f information. If all criteria are like “the response mentions A”, “the response
 mentions B”, then this is not a good rubric. Volume Rubric There are less than
10 total rubric items OR there are less than 2 “process rubrics” N/A There are 1
0+ rubric items and there are 2+ “process rubrics” Rubric items are counted in s
um between the code and commentary rubrics

A process rubric is a rubric item about the process an agent follows to reach an
 answer (e.g., grepping the codebase, reading file foo.py Rubric Supporting Cont
ext Rubric Supporting Context 3+ rubric supporting context items are missing or
incorrect 1-2 rubric supporting context items are missing or incorrect All rubri
c supporting context items are correct Evaluate that the rubric supporting conte
xt is correct and accurate to the commit diff or other sources of GTFA

I have reviewed the Cursor SWE Agent Problem Reviewing Rubric. I understand the
different categories for evaluating the prompt and rubrics, the scoring system (
1-5), and the specific criteria for each category like Naturalness, Self Contain
ed & Solvable, Correctness, Classification Correctness, Completeness, No Overlap
ping, Difficulty, Atomicity, Specificity, Self Contained (for rubrics), Diversit
y, Volume, and Rubric Supporting Context. I'm ready for the next steps.

What are Rubrics?

The rubrics are a list of specific and simple questions that can be evaluated as
 true or false for any given response to the prompt. Consider all the elements y
ou need to include to create a perfect response and put them into the rubric. Yo
u should review the evaluation criteria for the different dimensions your rubric
s will be evaluated on. You should also review the common errors section for exa
mples of good and bad rubrics.

I understand that rubrics are a list of specific, simple, true/false questions u
sed to evaluate a response to the prompt. They should encompass all elements of
a perfect response. I'll keep in mind the evaluation criteria and common errors.

Critical Rubrics - Response Successes. These are the critical rubrics that the r
eference answer successfully achieved with a “YES”. Think of them like the main
requirements from the prompt. For example, if the prompt requested a Python func
tion that adds two numbers, the response must include that function and mention
that that function has been added. If it does, it is a Critical Success and must
 be included as a rubric item in this section.

Critical Rubrics - Response Fails. These are rubrics that the reference answer D
ID NOT have. For example, if the prompt requested a Python function that adds tw
o numbers, the response must include that function and mention that that functio
n has been added. If it doesn’t, it is a Critical Fail and must be included as a
 rubric item in this section.

Non-Critical Rubrics - Response Successes. These are rubrics that the reference
answer successfully achieved. Think of these as “nice-to-haves” that aren’t crit
ical for the response’s correctness. For example, if the prompt didn’t request f
or inline comments explaining the new functions, but the response includes these
 comments and they’re correct, it can be considered a non-critical success and s
hould be included as a rubric item in this section.

Non-Critical Rubrics - Response Fails. These are rubrics that the reference answ
er DID NOT achieve. For example, if the prompt didn’t request for inline comment
s explaining the new functions, and the response doesn’t include these comments,
 it can be considered a non-critical fail because it’s good practice to add them
 and should be included as a r

I understand the four categories for classifying rubrics based on criticality (C
ritical/Non-Critical) and whether the reference answer achieved them (Success/Fa
il). This will help in creating a balanced set of rubrics.

Example of a Good Rubric:

Does the response modify the formatting logic for the string dtype so that \n, \
t, and \r characters are escaped when displayed?

Does the response use an existing formatting utility to apply escaping, rather t
han manually escaping characters?

Does the response pass the escape characters argument when invoking the formatti
ng utility to ensure \n, \t, and \r characters are handled in the utility?

Does the response ensure that the quoting behavior of strings is preserved when
the boxed output is enabled?

Does the response modify a method in the file responsible for rendering or forma
tting the display of string values, rather than affecting data parsing or intern
al storage?

Does the response document any new method that handles the formatting logic to e
scape the \n, \t, and \r characters?

I have reviewed the example of a good rubric. I see how each item is a specific,
 answerable yes/no question related to the expected changes or qualities of the
response.

Why is this a Good Rubric?

✅ The rubric provides means to asses the code changes for a good response to the
 prompt. The rubric items do not overlap with each other, are difficult enough t
o challenge the model, and are objective and self-contained.

I understand why the provided example is a good rubric: it effectively assesses
code changes, its items are distinct, challenging, objective, and self-contained
. This clarifies the qualities I should aim for in my own rubrics.

The following is an example of a Good task submitted in the Ballerina Capuchina
project ⭐

↪ Why was this correct?

While we need a diverse set of types of questions, many attempters focus on only
 providing Code Structure questions. Choosing a wide variety of questions across
 the tasks is important to maintain data variation in the dataset.

↪ Why was this question correct?

The question is specific to the repository in the task. The question is complex
enough so that even the strongest models might have an issue providing a complet
e answer to it.

↪ Why was this answer correct?

The provided answer was created using Claude 3.7 in Cursor. Providing GPT answer
s, or Claude answers not being crafted using Cursor will result in a bad quality
 task and a SBQ.

↪ Why were these rubrics correct?

These rubrics are self-contained, atomic, and they do not overlap.

The rubrics are specific to the code, and they do not only assess general progra
mming concepts.

Notice how the attempter provided a good number of Critical Rubrics fails.

The formatting follows the instructions as the rubrics continue the numeration a
cross the different fields.

↪ Why were these rubrics correct?

These rubrics are self-contained, atomic, and they do not overlap.

Notice how the attempter provided a good number of Non-Critical Rubrics fails.

The rubrics are specific to the code, and they do not only assess general progra
mming concepts.

The formatting follows the instructions as the rubrics continue the numeration a

↪ Why was the supporting context correct?

Each of the items maps directly to one of the numbered rubrics

The attempter provides justifications as to why the inclusion of the rubrics is
relevant.

I've reviewed the example of a good task and the explanations for why its compon
ents (question type diversity, question correctness, answer correctness, rubrics
 correctness, and supporting context correctness) were considered good. This pro
vides a clear model of what a high-quality submission looks like, especially reg
arding the specificity of rubrics, the importance of critical fails, and accurat
e mapping in the supporting context.

Consider the following Prompt, Response, and Rubrics

CUrsor Question: Describe how the project handles message-to-JSON conversion wor
k for different types of content, particularly what the JSON structure looks lik
e if I have a message with both text and images and the differences between seve
ral conversion key functions implemented in @remote_inference_engine.py Referenc
e Answer

Message-to-JSON Conversion in Remote Inference Engine
This project implements a sophisticated message-to-JSON conversion system in the
 RemoteInferenceEngine class that handles both text and multimodal content (text
 + images) for Open-ai API compatibility. Here's how it works:

Key Conversion Functions
The project has several key functions that handle the conversion process:

1. _get_content_for_message_content_item() (lines 216-252)
This is the core function that converts individual content items to JSON format:
 Text content: Converts to {"type": "text", "text": "<content>"} Image content:
Handles three image types:

IMAGE_BINARY: Encodes binary data as base64 with MIME prefix `IMAGE_URL': Uses t
he URL directly
`IMAGE_PATH': Loads the image file and converts to base64
2. _get_content_for_message() (lines 200-210)
Processes all content items in a message by calling _get_content_for_message_con
tent_item() for each item.

3. _get_list_of_message_json_dicts() (lines 253-309)
The main orchestrator that:

Converts a list of messages to JSON format
Handles role grouping (adjacent messages from same role)

Optimizes simple text-only messages to use string content instead of arrays
4. _convert_conversation_to_api_input() (lines 310-385)
Is a crucial method that converts an internal conversation format into the forma
t expected by the Open-ai ΑΡΙ

JSON Structure Examples
For a message with both text and images:
{ json "role": "user", "content":[ { "type": "image_url", "image_url":{ } "url":
 "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..." "type":"text", "text": "Hel
lo" } }, } "type":"text", "text": "there"

For simple text-only messages:
{ !.. json "role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant!"

Key Differences Between Conversion Functions
Content Item Level
(_get_content_for_message_content_item`): Handles individual pieces of content (
text or image) Performs image loading and base64 encoding

Returns single content item JSON
Message Level (_get_content_for_message): Processes all content items within a s
ingle message Returns array of content item JSONS
Conversation Level (_get_list_of_message_json_dicts`): - Handles multiple messag
es with role information
Implements optimization for text-only messages
Supports role grouping for adjacent same-role messages
API Level (_convert_conversation_to_api_input`):
Creates complete Open-ai API payload
Adds generation parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.) Handles guided decodi
ng and JSON schema constraints

Image Handling Specifics
The system handles images through several utility functions:

load_image_bytes_to_content_item(): Loads images from URLs or file paths base64e
ncode_content_item_image_bytes(): Converts image bytes to base64 with MIME prefi
x - Images are always converted to PNG format and encoded as data:image/png;base
64,<base64_data>
Role Grouping Feature
The group_adjacent_same_role_turns parameter allows combining consecutive messag
es from the same role into a single JSON message with multiple content items - t
his is particularly useful for multimodal conversations where a user might send
multiple images and text in sequence. This design provides a flexible, robust sy
stem for converting complex multimodal conversations into Open-ai API-compatible
 JSON while maintaining efficiency through optimizations for common cases like s
imple text messages.

Now I will give you the question and options choose the correct one

I have reviewed the provided Cursor Question, Reference Answer, and the categori
zed Rubrics (Critical Successes, Critical Fails, Non-Critical Successes, Non-Cri
tical Fails). I'm ready for the knowledge check question.

What is wrong with Rubric Item #3? a) There is nothing wrong: the rubric is self
-contained and well-specified. b)The rubric is too focused on the PR implementat
ion as it mentions function and file names. c)The rubric introduces an hallucina
tion in the response, but the rubric is atomic and uses objective language. d)Th
e rubric is not self-contained as the names of the reference functions is not in
cluded and it uses subjective language.

Let's break down Rubric Item #3: "Does the response name at least two helper fun
ctions defined in remote_inference_engine.py and correctly describe their respec
tive scopes (content-level, message-level, conservation-level)?"

The core issue often revolves around the principles of good rubric design: self-
containment, objectivity, atomicity, etc.

Self-Contained: A rubric item is self-contained if it can be evaluated without n
eeding external information beyond the response itself. This rubric requires kno
wledge of:

Which functions are actually defined in remote_inference_engine.py.
What the correct scopes (content-level, message-level, conversation-level) are f
or those functions according to the codebase. This information is external to th
e rubric item itself. A more self-contained version might specify example functi
ons or the criteria for scope classification directly.
Objective Language: "Correctly describe" is objective if there's a clear, verifi
able ground truth for the scopes. Assuming the codebase provides this ground tru
th, this part is objective.
Now let's evaluate the options:

a) There is nothing wrong: the rubric is self-contained and well-specified.

This is debatable due to the self-containment issue. It's specified, but might n
ot be perfectly self-contained according to strict definitions.
b) The rubric is too focused on the PR implementation as it mentions function an
d file names.

The question asks about how the project handles something, implying an inquiry a
bout the existing system (remote_inference_engine.py). This is a valid type of q
uestion to understand a codebase, not necessarily tied to a new PR's specific is
olated changes. Mentioning file/function names is appropriate for questions abou
t implementation details.
c) The rubric introduces an hallucination in the response, but the rubric is ato
mic and uses objective language.

A rubric evaluates a response; it doesn't introduce hallucinations. This stateme
nt confuses the role of the rubric. Whether the reference answer has hallucinati
ons is a separate concern.
d) The rubric is not self-contained as the names of the reference functions is n
ot included and it uses subjective language.

"not self-contained as the names of the reference functions is not included": Th
is is a valid criticism. To evaluate if the response names correct functions and
 their correct scopes, the evaluator needs this external knowledge.
"it uses subjective language": As discussed, "correctly describe" can be objecti
ve if the correctness is verifiable against the codebase. So this part of option
 (d) is weaker.
Considering the provided guidelines: "Self Contained: Each criterion should cont
ain all the information needed to evaluate a response... Criterion should be ver
ifiable without requiring external search." Rubric #3 requires the evaluator to
know (or look up in remote_inference_engine.py) the valid functions and their sc
opes. This is an external search.

Therefore, the primary flaw is that it's not fully self-contained. Option (d) is
 the closest to identifying this, despite the potential quibble over "subjective
 language."

Final Answer: d) The rubric is not self-contained as the names of the reference
functions is not included and it uses subjective language.

what about other options why it is not correct.

Okay, let's break down why the other options are less correct for Rubric Item #3
: "Does the response name at least two helper functions defined in remote_infere
nce_engine.py and correctly describe their respective scopes (content-level, mes
sage-level, conservation-level)?"

a) There is nothing wrong: the rubric is self-contained and well-specified.

Why it's not correct: The main issue is with "self-contained." As per the guidel
ines ("Each criterion should contain all the information needed to evaluate a re
sponse... Criterion should be verifiable without requiring external search."), t
his rubric item isn't perfectly self-contained. To verify it, an evaluator needs
 to:
Know or look up which helper functions exist in remote_inference_engine.py.
Know or look up the correct scopes for these functions. This information isn't p
rovided within the rubric item itself, requiring reference to the codebase (an e
xternal search). While it's "well-specified" in what it asks for, the lack of co
mplete self-containment is a flaw according to the defined best practices.
b) The rubric is too focused on the PR implementation as it mentions function an
d file names.

Why it's not correct: The original Cursor Question is: "Describe how the project
 handles message-to-JSON conversion work for different types of content, particu
larly what the JSON structure looks like if I have a message with both text and
images and the differences between several conversion key functions implemented
in @remote_inference_engine.py".
This question explicitly asks about functions within @remote_inference_engine.py
. Therefore, a rubric item that checks for the mention and correct description o
f these functions is directly relevant to the question asked. It's about underst
anding the existing codebase, not necessarily about a new change introduced by a
 hypothetical PR (unless the PR was about these functions, but the question itse
lf is about the current state). Questions about implementation details, includin
g specific files and functions, are valid for understanding a repository.
c) The rubric introduces an hallucination in the response, but the rubric is ato
mic and uses objective language.

Why it's not correct: This option misunderstands the role of a rubric.
A rubric is a question used to evaluate a response. It doesn't introduce content
 (like hallucinations) into the response. It checks if the response contains cer
tain information or meets certain criteria.
Whether the reference answer itself contains a hallucination is a separate issue
 from the quality of the rubric item. The rubric item is asking if the model's r
esponse correctly identifies and describes functions. If the model hallucinates
functions, it would fail this rubric, which is the rubric working as intended.
While the rubric is arguably atomic (checking for function names + scope descrip
tion as a combined element) and uses objective language ("correctly describe" as
sumes a verifiable truth), the premise that the rubric introduces a hallucinatio
n is flawed.
Therefore, option (d) remains the most accurate critique because the lack of exp
licit function names (or examples) within the rubric item itself means the evalu
ator must consult the remote_inference_engine.py file, violating the strict prin
ciple of self-containment.

its not about less correct if other answers also matches count it

You're asking for an evaluation of each option to see if any part of it correctl
y identifies a characteristic or flaw of Rubric Item #3, not just the single bes
t or most complete answer. Let's do that.

Rubric Item #3: "Does the response name at least two helper functions defined in
 remote_inference_engine.py and correctly describe their respective scopes (cont
ent-level, message-level, conservation-level)?"

a) There is nothing wrong: the rubric is self-contained and well-specified.

Is the statement "the rubric is ... well-specified" correct? Yes, it can be argu
ed that the rubric clearly specifies what is being checked: naming at least two
functions from a particular file and correctly describing their scopes.
Is the statement "the rubric is self-contained" correct? No, not according to th
e strict guidelines provided (requires external lookup of function names/scopes)
.
Conclusion for (a): Contains one correct assertion ("well-specified") and one in
correct assertion ("self-contained"). So, it partially matches if we consider th
e "well-specified" part.
b) The rubric is too focused on the PR implementation as it mentions function an
d file names.

Is this statement correct? No. The rubric's focus on function and file names is
a direct consequence of the Cursor Question, which asks for details about remote
_inference_engine.py. It's about understanding the existing codebase as requeste
d by the prompt, not necessarily a PR implementation.
Conclusion for (b): This option does not correctly identify a characteristic or
flaw in this context.
c) The rubric introduces an hallucination in the response, but the rubric is ato
mic and uses objective language.

Is the statement "The rubric introduces an hallucination in the response" correc
t? No, this is a misunderstanding of a rubric's role. Rubrics evaluate; they don
't inject content.
Is the statement "the rubric is atomic" correct? This is debatable. It asks for
two distinct pieces of information (function names AND scope descriptions). For
maximal atomicity, these could be separate rubrics. However, it's often acceptab
le to group tightly related checks. So, "atomic" is arguable, not definitively c
orrect or incorrect without stricter local definitions of atomicity.
Is the statement "[the rubric] uses objective language" correct? Yes. "Correctly
 describe" implies a factual, verifiable answer based on the codebase, making it
 objective.
Conclusion for (c): Contains one incorrect assertion (introduces hallucination),
 one debatable assertion (atomic), and one correct assertion (uses objective lan
guage). So, it partially matches if we consider the "objective language" part, a
nd potentially the "atomic" part depending on interpretation.
d) The rubric is not self-contained as the names of the reference functions is n
ot included and it uses subjective language.

Is the statement "The rubric is not self-contained as the names of the reference
 functions is not included" correct? Yes, this is a valid criticism based on the
 provided guidelines.
Is the statement "[the rubric] uses subjective language" correct? This is less l
ikely to be correct. "Correctly describe" usually implies an objective standard
(the actual implementation in the code). It would only be subjective if "correct
ly" was undefined and open to personal opinion, which is not typical for code an
alysis rubrics.
Conclusion for (d): Contains one correct assertion (not self-contained) and one
likely incorrect assertion (uses subjective language).
Summary of correct assertions within each option:

a) Contains: "the rubric is ... well-specified" (Correct)
b) Contains: No clearly correct assertions in this context.
c) Contains: "[the rubric] uses objective language" (Correct); "the rubric is at
omic" (Debatable/Arguably Correct)
d) Contains: "The rubric is not self-contained as the names of the reference fun
ctions is not included" (Correct)
So, if the question is which options contain at least one correct statement abou
t Rubric #3 (even if other parts of the option are flawed):

Option (a) contains a correct statement.
Option (c) contains a correct statement (and a debatable one that could be seen
as correct).
Option (d) contains a correct statement.
This means options (a), (c), and (d) all contain elements that correctly describ
e or critique Rubric #3 to some extent.

Jules I have to pass this test to ge thte project so go through it give me one a
nswer If I fail I will have no work please carefully go through again give me on
e final answer

Okay, I understand the pressure. I will provide the single best answer based on
a careful re-evaluation of the options against the provided rubric guidelines.

Rubric Item #3: "Does the response name at least two helper functions defined in
 remote_inference_engine.py and correctly describe their respective scopes (cont
ent-level, message-level, conservation-level)?"

Key Guideline for Self-Contained Rubrics: "Each criterion should contain all the
 information needed to evaluate a response... Criterion should be verifiable wit
hout requiring external search."

Let's analyze each option critically to select the one that most accurately iden
tifies a flaw based on this and other rubric principles:

a) There is nothing wrong: the rubric is self-contained and well-specified.

This option claims the rubric is self-contained. However, to verify if the named
 functions are correct and their scopes are correctly described, the evaluator m
ust consult the remote_inference_engine.py file. This is an external search, vio
lating the self-containment principle. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
b) The rubric is too focused on the PR implementation as it mentions function an
d file names.

The original Cursor Question explicitly asks to "Describe how the project handle
s message-to-JSON conversion work... and the differences between several convers
ion key functions implemented in @remote_inference_engine.py". The rubric item d
irectly addresses this by checking for knowledge of these functions. It's about
understanding the existing codebase as requested by the prompt, not about a PR (
unless the PR is specifically about these functions, which is not implied to be
a restriction for rubric creation). Thus, this option is incorrect.
c) The rubric introduces an hallucination in the response, but the rubric is ato
mic and uses objective language.

The phrase "The rubric introduces an hallucination in the response" is a fundame
ntal misunderstanding. A rubric evaluates a response; it doesn't add content to
it. This makes the main premise of the option incorrect. While other parts like
"atomic" or "objective language" might be arguable or true, the initial incorrec
t premise invalidates it as the best description of what's wrong.
d) The rubric is not self-contained as the names of the reference functions is n
ot included and it uses subjective language.

"The rubric is not self-contained as the names of the reference functions is not
 included": This is a direct, clear, and accurate criticism. To properly evaluat
e whether the response correctly names functions from remote_inference_engine.py
 and their scopes, the evaluator needs to know what those functions and scopes a
re. This information (the ground truth or "reference functions") is not provided
 within the rubric item itself, necessitating an external lookup in the codebase
. This directly violates the self-containment guideline.
"it uses subjective language": This part is the weaker claim. "Correctly describ
e" is generally objective if there's a verifiable ground truth for the scopes in
 the codebase. The primary strength of this option lies in its correct identific
ation of the self-containment issue.
Final Decision for the Single Best Answer:

The most significant, undisputed flaw, when judged against the provided rubric d
esign principles (especially self-containment), is that the rubric item is not s
elf-contained. Option (d) is the only one that correctly identifies this. While
the second part of option (d) regarding subjective language is debatable, the fi
rst part about self-containment is a clear and critical issue according to the g
uidelines you've shared.

Therefore, the single best answer is:

d) The rubric is not self-contained as the names of the reference functions is n
ot included and it uses subjective language.

This is because the lack of self-containment is a definite flaw according to the
 rules provided.

ok now 2.How would you rate Rubric Item #4? Select all that apply.

a) How would you rate Rubric Item #4? Select all that apply.

b) It is incorrect as it is not explaining what needs to be referenced directly.
 The evaluator will need to look for information outside of the rubric and the q
uestion in order to discern the outcome of the rubric.

c) It is correct as it doesn’t overlap with previous rubrics and it is assessing
 a specific criteria that a state of the art model response should have. d) It i
s incorrect as the information in the rubric is being assessed also in Rubric It
em #5.

Today 15:59
Final Answer for Question 2, regarding Rubric Item #4:

Rubric Item #4: "Does the response restrict every code reference to the slice sr
c/oumi/inference/remote_inference_engine.py:50-180, with no references outside t
hat range?"

Applicable options:

b) It is incorrect as it is not explaining what needs to be referenced directly.
 The evaluator will need to look for information outside of the rubric and the q
uestion in order to discern the outcome of the rubric.

This is applicable if interpreted as Rubric #4 imposing an arbitrary constraint
(the 50-180 slice) not motivated by the original prompt, thus making the rubric
item's purpose unclear or unjustified.
d) It is incorrect as the information in the rubric is being assessed also in Ru
bric Item #5.

This is applicable due to the overlap in assessment: referencing code outside th
e 50-180 slice would likely cause a 'no' for both Rubric #4 and parts of Rubric
#5.
Therefore, the selections are b and d.

you sure about option a and c

Yes, I am sure.

Option (a) is part of the question's instructions, not an answer choice.
Option (c) is not a correct assessment of Rubric Item #4. The justification it p
rovides (that Rubric #4 assesses a criterion a state-of-the-art model should hav
e) is flawed because the specific constraint in Rubric #4 (restricting reference
s to lines 50-180) is arbitrary if not directly requested by the original prompt
.
The flaws in Rubric Item #4 are best identified by options (b) and (d).

3.What is the main, failing issue with Rubric Item #11? a)It does not reference
the file name. b) It overlaps with other rubric items. c) It uses subjective lan
guage. d)It is not self-contained

Let's analyze Rubric Item #11 to identify its main, failing issue.

Rubric Item #11: "Does the response state the default value of the group_adjacen
t_same_role_turns parameter?"

This was a "Non-Critical Rubrics - Response Fails" item.

Evaluating the options:

a) It does not reference the file name.

The parameter group_adjacent_same_role_turns is related to the RemoteInferenceEn
gine in remote_inference_engine.py as per the context of the overall example. Wh
ile adding the filename (remote_inference_engine.py) or class name could improve
 explicitness, its absence isn't necessarily the main, failing issue if the para
meter is unambiguous within the context of the question and reference answer. It
's more of a minor clarity point than a fundamental flaw.
b) It overlaps with other rubric items.

Rubric #9 (Non-Critical Success) was: "Does the response mention the role-groupi
ng feature that merges consecutive messages from the same role?"
Rubric #11 asks for the default value of group_adjacent_same_role_turns, which i
s a parameter for the role-grouping feature.
These are related but distinct aspects: one checks for mention of the feature, t
he other for a specific detail (default value of a parameter) of that feature. T
his is not a direct overlap where the same fact is being checked twice. So, this
 is unlikely the main failing issue.
c) It uses subjective language.

The rubric asks, "Does the response state the default value...?" The term "state
" is objective. The default value itself is a factual piece of information (e.g.
, True, False, a specific number). The language here is objective, not subjectiv
e (like "Is the explanation good?"). So, this option is incorrect.
d) It is not self-contained.

The guideline for self-containment: "Each criterion should contain all the infor
mation needed to evaluate a response... Criterion should be verifiable without r
equiring external search." (except for the response itself).
To evaluate Rubric #11, an evaluator needs to know:
Does the AI's response state a default value for group_adjacent_same_role_turns?
Crucially, what is the correct default value of this parameter according to the
codebase or its documentation? Without this information, the evaluator cannot co
nfirm if any value stated in the response is the actual default value.
Rubric Item #11 does not provide this correct default value (e.g., it doesn't sa
y, "Does the response state that the default value ... is True?").
Therefore, the evaluator must look up the true default value externally (from th
e code or docs). This directly violates the self-containment principle.
Conclusion:

The most significant flaw, and thus the "main, failing issue," with Rubric Item
#11 is that it is not self-contained. It requires the evaluator to possess exter
nal knowledge (the actual default value of the parameter) to correctly assess th
e response.

Final Answer: d) It is not self-contained

How would you rate Rubric Item #12. Select one answer. a) It is correct as it is
 specific to the code in the repository b)It is correct as it uses objective lan
guage. c)It is incorrect because the boolean condition is not directly specified
. d)It is incorrect because it overlaps with another rubric dealing with boolean
 conditions in the code.

Rubric Item #12: "Does the response specify the exact boolean condition the code
 uses to decide when to collapse a text-only message into the short form?"

Options:

a) It is correct as it is specific to the code in the repository (True, but not
necessarily the defining rating if flaws exist elsewhere based on rubric princip
les).
b) It is correct as it uses objective language (True, also not necessarily the d
efining rating if flaws exist).
c) It is incorrect because the boolean condition is not directly specified (This
 highlights a lack of self-containment, a key rubric design principle, as the ev
aluator would need to know the condition from an external source).
d) It is incorrect because it overlaps with another rubric dealing with boolean
conditions in the code (Unverifiable with the provided information).
Considering the emphasis on rubric design principles, especially self-containmen
t, option (c) points to the most significant issue for rating this rubric item b
ased on adherence to those principles.

Final Answer: c) It is incorrect because the boolean condition is not directly s
pecified.

5.Is there any other issue with the set of rubrics presented? a) No, the rest of
 the rubrics are correct. b)Yes, Rubric Item #14 is not self contained. c)Yes, t
here are formatting issues in the rubrics

Final Answer for Question 5:

Rubric Item #14 (for context of option b): "Does the response discuss performanc
e considerations such as base64 size overhead or total payload size when convert
ing messages?"

a) No, the rest of the rubrics are correct. (Incorrect if (c) is true)
b) Yes, Rubric Item #14 is not self contained. (Likely incorrect. Rubric #14 ask
s about the presence of discussion on named topics, which is self-contained as t
he topics are provided.)
c) Yes, there are formatting issues in the rubrics. (Correct. The example image
shows extraneous user-like identifiers, e.g., "vanesa.petra", next to rubric ite
ms, which constitutes a formatting issue.)
Final Answer: c) Yes, there are formatting issues in the rubrics

8.What is a key feature of “critical” rubrics mentioned in the rubric-writing gu
idelines? a)They must be related to critical components of the code in the repos
itory. b)They should always relate to formatting only. c) They are distinguished
 from “non-critical” rubrics as they need to be present in an answer to the ques
tion for it to be considered correct. d)They require fewer rubric items per ques
tion as they focus on critical code elements

9.Which of the following best explains a Non-Critical Success rubric item? a)A p
rompt-required element that was incorrectly implemented b)A desirable feature no
t required by the prompt that was successfully included c)A required feature tha
t was partially implemented d)An extra feature that was nice-to-have, but not ac
tually present in the response

10.Which model is the only one approved to use when trying to come up with bette
r rubrics? a)Claude 3.7 b)Deepseek c) GPT o3 d) Claude 4.7

Here are the answers for questions 6-10:

6. Which of the following best explains what makes a rubric item "atomic"?

c) It evaluates exactly one distinct aspect of the response
Justification: The guidelines explicitly state for Atomicity: "Each rubric crite
rion should evaluate exactly one distinct aspect. Avoid bundling multiple criter
ia into a single rubric."
7. What is the required format for listing rubric items?

b) Numbered list with each item on a new row
Justification: All provided examples of rubrics (e.g., "Example of a Good Rubric
," the detailed breakdown of Critical/Non-Critical rubrics in the image) use a n
umbered list. The review example also notes: "The formatting follows the instruc
tions as the rubrics continue the numeration across the different fields."
8. What is a key feature of “critical” rubrics mentioned in the rubric-writing g
uidelines?

c) They are distinguished from “non-critical” rubrics as they need to be present
 in an answer to the question for it to be considered correct.
Justification: The guidelines describe "Critical Rubrics - Response Successes" a
s being "like the main requirements from the prompt." This implies that these ar
e essential for a correct and complete answer.
9. Which of the following best explains a Non-Critical Success rubric item?

b) A desirable feature not required by the prompt that was successfully included
Justification: The guidelines define "Non-Critical Rubrics - Response Successes"
 as "nice-to-haves that aren’t critical for the response’s correctness," providi
ng an example of correctly included inline comments that weren't explicitly requ
ested.
10. Which model is the only one approved to use when trying to come up with bett
er rubrics?

a) Claude 3.7
Justification: The guidelines for collecting the Reference Answer (which is the
foundation for creating rubrics) state: "Write your question in Cursor and selec
t Claude Sonnet 3.7 in AGENT mode." Also, the "What Do You Have to Deliver?" sec
tion says for the Reference Answer: "Use Claude Sonnet 3.7 or Claude Sonnet 4 in
 Cursor". The example of a good task explicitly mentions: "The provided answer w
as created using Claude 3.7 in Cursor." Given the phrasing "only one approved" a
nd the consistent, specific mentions of "Claude 3.7" (Sonnet) for generating the
 reference material that directly informs rubric creation, this is the most stro
ngly supported answer among the options.

Jules out of 10 i need atleast 9 questions answered correct to get the project.
So we have to get 10 out 10 correct so we have margin of error 1 So please caref
ully examine all ten again and list the ten answers eleminate only options which
 are correct. if there are possible two correct answrs for the question then dis
play two wth confidence percentage of the correct one. Then lets decide on those
 questions

Okay, I have performed a final meticulous review of all questions and answers ba
sed on the provided documentation.

1. What is wrong with Rubric Item #3?

Final Choice: d) It is not self-contained as the names of the reference function
s is not included and it uses subjective language.
Confidence: 95%. (Primary flaw: lack of self-containment. Secondary point on sub
jective language is less critical but doesn't invalidate the primary flaw.)
2. How would you rate Rubric Item #4? Select all that apply.

Final Choices: b and d
b) Interpreted as: Rubric #4 is flawed because it imposes an arbitrary constrain
t (the 50-180 slice) not motivated by the original prompt. (Confidence: 80%)
d) Clear overlap with Rubric Item #5 in penalizing references outside the 50-180
 slice. (Confidence: 95%)
3. What is the main, failing issue with Rubric Item #11?

Final Choice: d) It is not self-contained.
Reasoning: The rubric does not provide the expected default value for the parame
ter, requiring external lookup.
Confidence: 99%
4. How would you rate Rubric Item #12. Select one answer.

Final Choice: c) It is incorrect because the boolean condition is not directly s
pecified.
Reasoning: The rubric does not state the expected boolean condition, thus lackin
g self-containment.
Confidence: 95%
5. Is there any other issue with the set of rubrics presented?

Final Choice: c) Yes, there are formatting issues in the rubrics.
Reasoning: The example image shows extraneous user-like identifiers (e.g., "vane
sa.petra") alongside rubric items.
Confidence: 90%
6. Which of the following best explains what makes a rubric item "atomic"?

Final Choice: c) It evaluates exactly one distinct aspect of the response.
Reasoning: This is a direct definition from the guidelines.
Confidence: 100%
7. What is the required format for listing rubric items?

Final Choice: b) Numbered list with each item on a new row.
Reasoning: Consistent with all provided examples and guideline implications.
Confidence: 100%
8. What is a key feature of “critical” rubrics mentioned in the rubric-writing g
uidelines?

Final Choice: c) They are distinguished from “non-critical” rubrics as they need
 to be present in an answer to the question for it to be considered correct.
Reasoning: Aligns with guidelines stating critical rubrics reflect main prompt r
equirements.
Confidence: 100%
9. Which of the following best explains a Non-Critical Success rubric item?

Final Choice: b) A desirable feature not required by the prompt that was success
fully included.
Reasoning: Matches the guideline definition of "nice-to-haves."
Confidence: 100%
10. Which model is the only one approved to use when trying to come up with bett
er rubrics?

Final Choice: a) Claude 3.7
Reasoning: Claude Sonnet 3.7 is the most explicitly and repeatedly mentioned spe
cific model version for generating the Reference Answer, which is foundational f
or rubric creation. The phrase "only one approved" points to this specific model
 from the options.

uality task submissions and the requirement of passing a knowledge check with at
 least 60%. I also note the reference to reviewing common errors and the evaluat
ion rubric in the project specifications.

**Rubrics Most Common Error: **Misclassifying Non-Critical Failures as Critical
Failures

Every rubric must also be classified as critical or non-critical. Frequently non
-critical rubrics are misclassified as critical. Its important to remember that
critical rubrics are ones that must pass for an answer to be correct and directl
y relate to the content of the question and the necessary components of a good s
olution. If a rubric is item is not vitally needed to answer a question, then it
 should be classified as non-critical.

Question Most Common Error: Creating a Question that is too Easy

Cursor models struggle with solving prompts that involve relationships between m
ultiple files.

Harder prompts rely on data from multiple parts of the codebase that require the
 agent to synthesize knowledge from multiple files, especially how multiple file
s interact.

Creating a prompt that is complex is ESSENTIAL to do well in this project.

Top Tips For Writing Harder Prompts

Multiple Files - These agents often struggle with tasks that require maintaining
 and resolving references across many files. Ask questions that require understa
nding how a symbol is defined in one file, imported in another, and used in a th
ird. Use deeply nested or circular imports to confuse an agent. Include dynamic
imports or runtime module loading. Example - “What is the purpose of the resolve
() function defined in utils/loader.py, and how does it affect the behavior of b
uild_config() in config/builder.py?”

Implicit Coupling and Indirect Side Effects - Coding agents struggle with detect
ing indirect consequences (e.g., modifying shared mutable state in one function
and observing effects elsewhere). Ask questions that involve global state or mut
ation of shared objects (e.g., caches, class variables). Try introducing side ef
fects through decorators, context managers, or monkey-patching. Example - “Why d
oes changing the timeout in settings.py not affect the behavior of the fetch_wit
h_retry() function in networking/request.py?”

Abstract Design Reasoning - High-level architectural or refactor questions trip
up agents because they involve trade-offs, global knowledge, or incomplete goals
. Try asking about which files would need to change for a requirement. Example -
 “How would you change this system to support multi-tenancy with minimal code du
plication?”

Complex Control Flow or Asynchrony - Long async flows, error handling chains, an
d concurrency models (e.g., threads, coroutines, callbacks) create state trackin
g challenges. Use async/await chains with error propagation and shared state. Te
st agents’ ability to track control across try/except/finally. Example - “What h
appens if an exception is raised inside the await fetch_data() call in pipeline.
py? Will the cleanup step in main.py still run?”

FINAL TIP: Initial Quality Checks - Before continuing to write rubrics to verify
 that the Sonnet response truly fails, give the Sonnet response a quick “sniff t
est”. Does it seem like Sonnet correctly addressed all the critical parts of the
 question, or did it miss anything major? If it seems like Sonnet gave a strong
answer then it is likely worth rewriting your question to be harder instead of t
rying to force critical failure rubrics after you have written all the rubrics

I have reviewed the common errors and tips.

Regarding rubrics, the most common error is misclassifying Non-Critical Failures
 as Critical Failures. I understand critical rubrics must pass for an answer to
be correct and directly relate to the question's core content.

Regarding questions, the most common error is creating one that's too easy. I se
e the emphasis on prompts requiring synthesis of knowledge from multiple files a
nd understanding their interactions. The tips for writing harder prompts (Multip
le Files, Implicit Coupling/Indirect Side Effects, Abstract Design Reasoning, Co
mplex Control Flow/Asynchrony) and the examples are clear.

The final tip about performing an initial quality check on the Sonnet response b
efore writing rubrics is also noted – if Sonnet gives a strong answer, the quest
ion should be made harder.

I'm ready for the next section.

#2 Misclassifying SUCCESS and FAIL rubrics Other common error that we see is tha
t many rubrics are classified as Fail when the information is present in the ref
erence answer.

How to avoid this? Evaluate the Reference Answer against the Rubrics

Use the steps below to determine whether the response meets the core intent of e
ach rubric:

Understand the Rubric’s Purpose: Start by identifying the main goal of the rubri
c. Focus on what it’s fundamentally trying to check, and not just on specific wo
rding or phrasing.

Read the Response Carefully: Review the content of Response Claude, paying atten
tion to the main points and reasoning. Don’t get distracted by how it's worded.
Focus on what it's actually saying.

If the response clearly addresses the core idea or logic the rubric is targeting
, mark it as Success.

If the key point is missing or the requirement is not met, mark it as Fail.

Example of Misclassified Fail vs Success

Example Model Response:

The checkpoint saving mechanism in mmengine is primarily handled by the Checkpoi
ntHook class located in mmengine/hooks/checkpoint_hook.py. This class is part of
 the framework’s extensible hook system, which allows custom logic to be trigger
ed at specific stages of the training lifecycle managed by the Runner class.

Architectural Overview

The Runner class orchestrates the training loop and dispatches events such as be
fore_run, after_train_epoch, and after_train_iter.

CheckpointHook registers with the runner and listens to these lifecycle events.

When triggered, it decides whether to save a model checkpoint based on various c
onditions, such as a configured interval or performance metric.

Addition of save_ckpt_before_run

The PR introduces a new parameter save_ckpt_before_run to CheckpointHook.

If save_ckpt_before_run=True, the hook saves a checkpoint at the start of traini
ng—specifically during the before_run event.

Internally, this logic is added via an if check in the before_run() method of Ch
eckpointHook:


def before_run(self, runner):

*if *self.save_ckpt_before_run:

self._save_checkpoint(runner)``

❌ Rubric 12 (Incorrectly marked as a non-critical success):

12. Does the response mention filenames including checkpoint_hook.py and runner.
py to help locate components within the codebase?

Why was this wrong? Only checkpoint_hook.py is mentioned; runner.py is not inclu
ded.

 Also, this rubric is wrong because it is not atomic: the check for each file sh
ould be contained in a separate rubric.

❌ Rubric 13 (Incorrectly marked as a non-critical success):

Does the response provide the function signature of _save_checkpoint() to give i
nsight into its parameters and expected behavior?

Why was this wrong? The information is not present in the response. The response
 does not provide the function signature of _save_checkpoint().


I've reviewed the section on the common error of misclassifying SUCCESS and FAIL
 rubrics. I understand the importance of evaluating the Reference Answer against
 each rubric's core intent, rather than just specific wording.

The process is clear:

Understand the Rubric’s Purpose (focus on the fundamental check).
Read the Response Carefully (focus on what it's actually saying).
Mark as Success if the core idea/logic is addressed, Fail if the key point is mi
ssing or the requirement isn't met.
The examples of misclassified rubrics (Rubric 12 and Rubric 13) and the explanat
ions for why they were wrong are helpful. For Rubric 12, it was wrong because no
t all mentioned files were present in the response, and it also violated atomici
ty. For Rubric 13, it was wrong because the information (function signature) was
 simply not in the response.

I'm ready for the next part.

Misclassifying non-critical issues as critical is a recurring error

When expanding our rubric set, there’s often a tendency to rush and label items
as critical without fully assessing their impact. This can lead to overflagging
and reduce the overall reliability of the evaluation process. It's important to
take the time to carefully distinguish between genuinely critical failures and t
hose that are important but non-critical.

Critical rubrics are a MUST for a correct Response.

How can you assess whether a rubric you've written is truly critical?

Try this quick check: ask yourself—if the answer to this rubric is “No”, does th
at completely invalidate the response in the context of the main question? If th
e response would still be mostly valid or useful despite failing the rubric, the
n the rubric is likely not critical.

If failing this rubric would lead to an incomplete or incorrect answer, mark it
as Critical, otherwise is Non-Critical

❌ Example of Incorrectly Classified Rubrics

Question/Prompt:

How does the HistoryProcessor class in @history_ processors.py optimize memory u
sage when handling long conversation histories, and what trade-offs exist betwee
n caching strategies (e.g., truncation vs. compression) for scalability?

Rubric #2 (Misclassified as Critical):

Does the response quote or paraphrase the placeholder text "Old output omitted (
X lines)" that replaces pruned content in LastNObservations.last_n_history()?

↪ Why this is wrongly classified? Quoting or paraphrasing the placeholder text i
s not essential and does not impact the correctness of the answer.

Rubric #9 (Misclassified as Non-Critical):

Does the response give a table or prose comparison of truncation vs. compression
, outlining at least one advantage and one drawback of each?

↪ Why this is wrongly classified? This rubric assesses an essential comparison b
etween truncation and compression, which is critical to understanding the trade-
offs outlined in the prompt. It is necessary for a complete and correct answer a
nd should be marked as critical—not non-critical.

Take a look at the following example:

In this task, the contributor failed to get a Critical Rubric Fail, and wrote No
n-Critical Rubrics in the “Critical Rubrics - Response Fails“ field.

Why does this happen? The question might have been too easy for Claude 3.7 Sonne
t, so the contributor was unable to present a real Critical Fail in this task.

A task like the following will get a rating of 2.

Repo URL: https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react PR URL (if available
): - Commit URL: https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/commit/a847c8
41f6a34a9adde6bc3040a40426 a14e9f52 Cursor question: How does the filterRules fu
nction in eslint-plugin-react inside @all.js process and transform rule configur
ations, and what are the specific parameters and return values expected when fil
tering active versus deprecated rules? Critical Rubrics - Response Fails 3. Does
 the response identify at least one predicate commonly used in ESLint configurat
ions, such as filtering rules with 'meta.docs.recommended? 4. Does the response
mention that 'filterRules does not include any TypeScript type annotations in it
s declaration because it is written in plain JavaScript? 5. Does the response st
ate that 'filterRules' does not mutate the original 'rules' object, because it i
nstead returns a new filtered object?

I've reviewed the section on misclassifying non-critical issues as critical, and
 vice-versa.

I understand the core principle: Critical rubrics are a MUST for a correct respo
nse. The quick check is helpful: "if the answer to this rubric is 'No', does tha
t completely invalidate the response in the context of the main question?" If no
t, it's likely non-critical.

The examples provided are clear:

Rubric #2 (quoting placeholder text) was misclassified as Critical because faili
ng it doesn't invalidate the answer's core correctness regarding memory optimiza
tion and trade-offs.
Rubric #9 (comparison of truncation vs. compression) was misclassified as Non-Cr
itical because this comparison is essential to answer the prompt about trade-off
s and is necessary for a complete and correct answer.
The example of a task rated '2' due to failing to get a Critical Rubric Fail (an
d writing Non-Critical Rubrics in the Critical Fails field) also highlights the
importance of asking a sufficiently hard question. If the question is too easy,
it's difficult to identify genuine critical failures in the model's response.

I'm ready for the next part.

X -> indicates dont do the common error and its corresponding correcttion is giv
en under you should: section below

Common Errors in the Questions The question is too easy for the model: The model
 fully answers the question and this makes it difficult to write Critical Failur
es Rubrics. X Not being natural enough: Your prompts need to be realistic and be
 something a Software Developer may naturally ask in Cursor. X Don't ask several
 questions into one just to make the prompt more complex. While it might be natu
ral to have a follow up question to your main one, prompts with more than 2 ques
tions are not natural. X Copying the Issue Description in the prompt: The issue
description should be used for understanding and for getting inspiration, but th
e prompt shouldn't be too similar to it as it wouldn't create a significantly ne
w datapoint. • If the issue description has replication code, don't just copy it
. You can change the variable names, for example, to adapt it to another use cas
e. X Being too prescriptive: While the prompt needs to provide enough context an
d guidance, it shouldn't tell the model exactly what to do with the exact implem
entation from the PR. X Being too vague: The question should be realistic and ha
ve a specific answer to it. Don't just write extremely broad and open-ended ques
tions. X Not providing the file context in the prompt using @. X Writing prompts
 that look like GitHub issue descriptions: Think about what a developer might as
k a coding agent when debugging code. Avoid using fancy formatting: Avoid excess
ive use of backticks and markdown. Bullet points are fine, but try to avoid them
 to make the prompt more natural. DO NOT mention the PR or the commit in the pro
mpt! You Should: Write questions that reference multiple files and ask questions
 that require knowledge about interactions across the files. Use a natural and c
asual tone: Don't be formal! Remember you are a software developer talking to an
 Al agent. Focus on writing one question. You can add constraints and requiremen
ts to make it more specific. Provide context: Include enough context about the p
roblem and instructions on what the LLM should achieve, so that it has a good id
ea of what to address. You can do this by stating the relevant existing code or
behavior: The prompt should have the relevant contextual information to guide th
e model. • You can use @file_name to reference file names in Cursor. Reference r
elevant files: Reference other files by using the @file_name convention in Curso
r that provides that file as context. Be precise: Try to match the level of prec
ision you'd normally provide when prompting an LLM. Think about how you normally
 use ChatGPT or other models when coding, and write prompts that match your "bes
t" prompts to ChatGPT. Be careful with the level of detail, try to avoid being t
oo prescriptive when writing the prompt. • This means that if your prompt deals
with code changes, you shouldn't just give the agent a list with all the specifi
c code changes that are given in the PR. Instead, try to prompt the LLM in a way
 that gives room for different solutions, not just the one in the Gold Patch Exp
lain any constraints or requirements.

General Question Formatting Do not use excessive markdown and formatting in your
 prompt:

It should be written as a Cursor prompt a software developer may naturally write
.

The tone of the question should be first and foremost a search for information i
n the repository. Don’t focus on new code implementations.

The questions should be diverse in style. Please check the examples on the diffe
rent** **Question Types in the Specifications.

Do not copy the issue description or mention the PR in the question: The issue d
escription should only be used for understanding and for getting inspiration.

Need Help?

I've reviewed the "Other Common Errors: Question Dos and Don'ts of Question Writ

Not being natural/realistic for a Software Developer using Cursor.
Asking too many questions in one prompt (more than 2 is discouraged).
Copying the Issue Description or its replication code directly.
Being too prescriptive (not leaving room for different solutions, avoiding just
listing PR changes).
Being too vague (questions should have specific answers).
Not providing file context using @.
Writing prompts that look like GitHub issue descriptions.
Using excessive/fancy formatting (markdown, backticks; bullet points are okay bu
t to be used sparingly for naturalness).
Mentioning the PR or commit in the prompt.
And the corresponding "You Should" guidelines:

Write questions referencing multiple files and their interactions.
Use a natural, casual, informal tone.
Focus on one main question, adding constraints/requirements for specificity.
Provide context: relevant existing code/behavior, using @file_name.
Be precise, like a good prompt to ChatGPT, but avoid over-prescription.
Explain constraints or requirements.
Regarding general question formatting:

Avoid excessive markdown.
The tone should be a search for information in the repository, not focused on ne

Do not copy the issue description or mention the PR.
I'm ready for the next part or the knowledge check.

Examples of Questions Most Common Errors ❌ Error: The question is too easy to st
ump the model: How does the code figure out whether a content document has chang
ed or not before saving it, and what role does the hash value play in that proce
ss?

↪ Why is this an error?

This question too easy for Cursor models. Answering it requires basic code analy
sis that doesn’t involve searching across the repository.

⚠️ A question like this will make the rubrics writing for this project harder, a
s you will not find any Critical Fail Rubrics to write.

More easy prompts to avoid:

I'm working with the current implementation of the statsCard endpoint in @index.
js. If a user sends a request with ?username=undefined, it doesn't throw an erro
r or warning, and instead generates a card with the literal string "undefined" a
s the username. What might be causing this?

↪ Why is this an error?

This question only relies on checking one file and checking that the code has co
rrect error handling. This is too easy to solve for current models.

❌ Error: The question is too vague: Could you help me fix the TopKPooling class?
 It seems that there are some issues with the TorchScript support.

↪ Why is this considered an error? The given cursor question is overly vague, it
 does not describe what the issues in the TopKPooling class are. The questions s
hould be specific in the sense that it gives the model a clear scope of what the
 problem is, where the problem is located, etc.

❌ Error: Specificity: Too Prescriptive Telling the model EXACTLY what to do by d
escribing every single code change in detail While the question needs to provide
 enough context, it shouldn’t tell the model exactly what to do.

In the DVC repository, can you add a new API function so support saving DVC expe
riments programmatically? The function must enable saving a new experiment optio
nally under a user-specified name. It must force an overwrite if an experiment w
ith the same name already exists. It must also include specified untracked files
 in the saved experiment. You need to make sure that the API exposes the new fun
ction via the _ init_.py exports. The function must accept parameters for name,
force, and include_untracked, with appropriate default values. It must also retu
rn the Git revision string of the created experiment. The behavior when the expe
riment name already exists and force is False raises the expected ExperimentExis
tsError. The internal call to the repository's experiment save function is struc
tured to forward all three arguments. Also, documentation must be included in th
e function docstring. The files that are the primary context for these changes a
re @_ init_.py and @experiments.py.

↪ Why was this question wrong? The main issue here was that it tells the model e
xactly what to do. The prompt was not written as a Cursor question, but rather a
 general prompt. The question is also not natural enough.

✅ Fixed prompt:

I’m getting anExperimentExistsError when trying to save a new experiment. Could
you help me understand how the code saves DVC experiments programmatically via @
experiments.py and @_ init_.py and fix this?

↪ Why was this correct? There is a debugging and troubleshooting question that i
s natural for a software developer to ask.

✅ Example of a Good Question: How can the locale resolution logic, which uses fa
llback data defined in @config.py be redesigned in @locales.py to support O(1) p
rimary locale lookups and efficient fallback resolution, even across deeply nest
ed fallback chains?

↪ Why is this correct?

The given cursor question provides enough context by referencing two different f
iles, it is asking for a specific performance question that will make the agent
explore the codebase to find an answer.

I've reviewed the "Examples of Questions Most Common Errors" section.

I understand the following from the examples:

Error: Question too easy:

Example 1 (content document change & hash value): Wrong because it involves basi
c analysis within a limited scope, not requiring cross-repository search. This m
akes finding Critical Fail Rubrics hard.
Example 2 (statsCard endpoint with ?username=undefined): Wrong because it only r
equires checking one file and simple error handling, which is too easy for curre
nt models.
Error: Question too vague:

Example (fix TopKPooling class for TorchScript issues): Wrong because it doesn't
 describe the specific issues, lacking a clear scope for the model.
Error: Specificity - Too Prescriptive (telling the model EXACTLY what to do):

Example (add new API function in DVC repo with detailed step-by-step implementat
ion requirements): Wrong because it's overly prescriptive, reads like a general
prompt rather than a Cursor question, and isn't natural. It doesn't give the mod
el room to find a solution.
The Fixed prompt for this scenario is a good example of a more natural debugging
/troubleshooting question focused on understanding and fixing an error, referenc
ing the relevant files.
Example of a Good Question:

(Redesign locale resolution logic in @locales.py using fallback data from @confi
g.py for O(1) lookups and efficient fallback).
Correct because it provides context (referencing two files), asks a specific per
formance/design question, and requires the agent to explore the codebase for an
answer.
This clarifies the types of questions to avoid and the characteristics of good,
challenging questions. I'm ready for the next part.

Failing to select the correct Type of Question will result in a low quality task
.

We frequently see errors of questions that are not well-classified.

Make sure that the question you submit, either as an attempter or as a reviewer,
 is correctly classified in any of these categories.

In each task you’ll see the suggested Question Type. You are strongly encouraged
 to write your question following this, as your submissions should cover all the
 different question types, not just the one you feel confortable with!

Type of Question

Explanation

Question Examples

Questions on Implementation Details & Internal APIs:

These focus on understanding how specific code components work or produce result
s within the context of the problem.

Ask about how specific classes, methods, or modules in the repo are implemented
or intended to be used. May involve describing function signatures, clarifying i
nput/output

✅ Example Question: "Can you explain the logic flow within the process_data func
tion in @data_utils.py, and describe how it transforms the input data based on t
he parameters, especially in relation to how its output is utilized or further p
rocessed in @model_pipeline.py?"

✅ Example Question: "How should I correctly instantiate and use the Configuratio
nManager class to access the database connection string needed for this feature,
 and how does this approach align with the initialization and usage patterns obs
erved in both @config_loader.py and @database_client.py elsewhere in the reposit
ory?"

Debugging/Troubleshooting Questions:

These focus on diagnosing issues or understanding unexpected behavior related to
 a problem. The answer to these questions should explain or guide a troubleshoot
ing process for errors found in the repo, including reading logs, stack traces,
or error messages.

You can ask about verification checks for thoroughness in root cause analysis an
d clarity in describing how the repository’s codebase might produce or handle sp
ecific errors.

✅ Example Question: "I get a KeyError: 'user_id' encountered when processing the
 exported data. Can you identify where this error is occurring and fix it? The r
elevant modules seem to be @data_parser.py and @data_validator.py and I need to
ensure robust and fault-tolerant data handling in line with the repository’s pra
ctices."

Code Structure/ Design Questions

These focus on understanding the organization, relationships, or overall structu
re of the codebase relevant to the problem. The answers to these questions shoul
d provide high-level explanations about how the repo’s modules, services, or dat
a layers are structured, why they are designed that way, or how various componen
ts interact.

✅ Example Question: "Describe the relationship between the User model, the Authe
nticationService, and the LoginHandler within this project structure, particular
ly as they relate to the user login issue mentioned."

Questions on Best Practices and Patterns:

They aim to get recommendations for coding standards, design patterns, or librar
y usage within the context of the repo’s language, frameworks, or domain.

✅ Example Question: “What are the recommended design patterns or architectural a
pproaches for organizing service logic across @api_routes.py and @service_layer.
py, in order to maintain separation of concerns and ensure scalability within th
e existing framework used in the repository?”

Performance & Scalability Questions

Offer conceptual and code-level advice on optimizing and scaling the repo’s impl
ementation. Verification checks the alignment of suggestions with known performa
nce patterns (e.g., caching, load balancing) and correctness in referencing rele
vant parts of the provided code.

✅ Example Question: What is the impact of replacing the in-memory update logic w
ith a persistent traversal-based index updater in the keyValueIndexed database o
n the consistency, performance and modularity of the OrbitDB system?

Refactoring/Improvement Questions:

These focus on asking the AI for suggestions on improving existing code relevant
 to the problem. Another way to use the AI to "help you solve the problem", focu
sing on improving the code quality, efficiency, or maintainability in the area a
ffected by the problem statement.

✅ Example Question: "Can you suggest ways to refactor the redundant code blocks
found in @ModuleA.py and @ModuleB.py that handle similar data validation logic,
making it more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?"

I've reviewed the section on correctly classifying the "Type of Question."

I understand that failing to select the correct type results in a low-quality ta
sk and that it's a frequent error. It's important to classify questions accurate
ly based on their primary intent and to aim for diversity in question types acro
ss submissions, even if a suggested type is provided in the task.

The different question types and their explanations/examples are clear:

Questions on Implementation Details & Internal APIs: Focus on how specific code
components work or are used (e.g., logic flow, instantiation, usage patterns acr
oss files).
Debugging/Troubleshooting Questions: Focus on diagnosing issues or unexpected be
havior (e.g., identifying error origins, fixing them, ensuring robust handling).
Code Structure/Design Questions: Focus on understanding organization, relationsh
ips, or overall structure of the codebase (e.g., relationship between models, se
rvices, handlers).
Questions on Best Practices and Patterns: Aim for recommendations on coding stan
dards, design patterns, or library usage within the repo's context (e.g., design
 patterns for service logic organization).
Performance & Scalability Questions: Seek conceptual and code-level advice on op
timizing/scaling (e.g., impact of architectural changes on performance, consiste
ncy, modularity).
Refactoring/Improvement Questions: Ask for suggestions on improving existing cod
e quality, efficiency, or maintainability (e.g., refactoring redundant code).
I'm ready for the next part or the knowledge check.

Other Common Errors: Rubrics

Common Errors in the Rubrics X Vague descriptions with general and non-descripti
ve terms like "appropriate" or "correctly" without defining what is appropriate
or correct. This can lead to subjective interpretations of the criteria. • E.g.,
 "the response must be accurate" is a vague description if the rubric doesn't sp
ecify what is accurate in the context. X Mixing the Critical and Non-Critical ru
brics: Critical rubrics are those that MUST be present for the response to be co
nsidered correct. So, if the prompt explicitly asks for a new class, there shoul
d be a rubric for that marked as Critical. X Not providing a Complete rubric set
: All the rubric items combined should lead to a complete and perfect response.
Do not forget to write rubrics on critical information. Being too specific to an
 actual implementation, like the one in the PR. You can avoid this by mentioning
 the generalized fix that needs to be made. • Remember that an agent may solve t
he problem using a different solution than the one in the Gold Patch, and the ru
brics should be flexible enough to allow this. X Rubrics mention specific files
or functions/classes/ methods that are tied to only one implementation or respon
se. • You are allowed to mention code elements in the rubrics, but don't make th
e rubrics only specific to the answer that Claude 3.7 Sonnet is giving you. X Ru
brics that are not self-contained: · X "Does the response explain the function o
f the export expression node?" • ✓ "Does the response explain that the function
of the export expression node is to...?" X Overlapping criteria: • Each rubric i
tem should deal with one specific dimension. The same error from a model shouldn
't be punished multiple times. X Bundling multiple criteria into a single rubric
: • Most stacked criteria with the word "and" can be broken up into multiple pie
ces. You Should: ✓ The rubric should directly link to explicit instructions or m
easurable conditions: · Everyone who answers these questions should consistently
 arrive at the same conclusion. The rubrics should define precisely what is expe
cted. E.g. "The response should list exactly three examples, such as...". Rubric
s should include not only the facts and statements directly requested by the pro
mpt, but also the supporting details that provide justification, reasoning, and
logic for the response. The rubrics should be Mutually Exclusive and Collectivel
y Exhaustive. · Be careful with the wording and the use of synonyms. You shouldn
't ask the same thing twice. All the rubric items combined should lead to a comp
lete and perfect response. ✓ The rubric items should include variable types of i
nformation: If all criteria are like "the response mentions A", "the response me
ntions B", then this is not a good rubric. Each rubric item must be self-contain
ed. This means that they must contain all the information within the rubric that
 is needed to answer it. XE.g: "Does the response discuss the differences betwee
n 'foo' and bar" ✓E.g: "Does the response discuss at least two of the following
differences between foo and bar: runtime complexity, implementation difficulty,
overhead." ✓ Rubrics should be atomic: Do not bundle two questions into one. The
re should be a minimum of 10 rubric items.

Rubric Error: Rubrics that don't have positive logic Rubrics should always be wr
itten using positive logic. A rubric follows positive logic when a “Yes” answer
clearly means the response is successful or meets expectations. This framing imp
roves clarity, consistency, and reduces evaluator confusion.

In contrast, rubrics that use negative logic (where “Yes” means failure or a fla
w) are harder to interpret and more error-prone. They can lead to misjudgments,
especially when evaluators quickly scan checklists.

The goal is to ensure every rubric item is phrased so that a “Yes” confirms a de
sirable outcome of information that needs to be present in the response, making
evaluation more intuitive and aligned across reviewers.

⚠️ NOTE: Theres one edge case where this principle does not apply, and that is w
hen the question explicitly requests that something must not be present in the r
esponse.

❌ Example of rubrics that don’t have positive logic:

Does the response fail to mention that next_weekday in arrow/util.py uses dateut
il.rrule's WEEKLY frequency (line 33) rather than a simpler timedelta approach?

*Does the response *miss that next_weekday validates weekday bounds (0-6) but _p
arse_token does not?

Does the response ignore that test_parse_ddd_and_dddd in tests/test_parser.py us
es hardcoded datetime(1970, 1, 6) instead of dynamically computing the next Tues
day using next_weekday?

Does the agent avoid reading the same file (seaborn/ relational.py) more than on
ce during its analysis phase?

I have reviewed the "Other Common Errors: Rubrics" section again.

I've noted the common pitfalls such as:

Vague descriptions.
Mixing critical and non-critical classifications.
Incomplete rubric sets.
Over-specificity to a single implementation (like a PR solution) rather than all
owing for varied correct solutions.
Rubrics tied too closely to specific elements of only one possible response (e.g
., Sonnet's initial answer).
Lack of self-containment (e.g., not specifying the expected correct information
within the rubric itself).
Overlapping criteria (penalizing the same error multiple times).
Bundling multiple criteria into one rubric.
And the corresponding best practices:

Linking to explicit, measurable conditions for consistent evaluation.
Precisely defining expectations.
Including supporting details (justification, reasoning).
Ensuring rubrics are Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE).
Varying the types of information checked.
Making each rubric item self-contained and atomic.
Having a minimum of 10 rubric items.
Regarding the Rubric Error: Rubrics that don't have positive logic:

The core idea is that rubrics should be phrased so a "Yes" indicates success or
that the response meets expectations.
Negative logic (where "Yes" means a failure or flaw) is discouraged due to poten
tial confusion.
The exception is when the prompt explicitly asks for something not to be present
.
The examples clearly show rubrics that incorrectly use negative phrasing (e.g.,
"Does the response fail to mention...", "Does the response miss...", "Does the r
esponse ignore...", "Does the agent avoid reading...").
I am ready for the knowledge check or further instructions.

Rubric Error: Rubrics are NOT self-contained The rubric should directly include
explicit instructions or measurable conditions, meaning that the answer can be c
hecked factually based on the details in the rubric. Everyone who answers these
questions should consistently arrive at the same conclusion.

❌ Example: Does the response describe recursion instead of using the provided ca
llback for nested properties?

↪ This is not self-contained because it relies on external context that isn't ex
plicitly included in the rubric itself.

It references “the provided callback” , but doesn't define what that callback is
, what it's meant to do, or where it's provided.

It assumes knowledge of “nested properties” , without clarifying what those are
in this context.

The rubric expects the evaluator to know the intended or preferred behavior (i.e
., using the callback), but doesn't state it directly.

To make it self-contained: A self-contained rubric should include all the necess
ary information to understand and evaluate the requirement without needing to re
fer back to the prompt, code, or prior discussion.

Improved version:

✅ Does the response correctly use the specified handleNestedProps callback funct
ion to process nested object properties, instead of implementing custom recursio
n logic?

This version clarifies:

The name and role of the expected callback

The behavior that’s being discouraged (custom recursion)

The evaluation context (handling nested properties), all within the item itself.

I've reviewed the section "Rubric Error: Rubrics are NOT self-contained."

I understand the core principle: A self-contained rubric must include all necess
ary information and explicit instructions or measurable conditions so that anyon
e evaluating would consistently reach the same conclusion without needing extern
al context (beyond the AI's response itself).

The example provided is very clear:

Incorrect (Not self-contained): "Does the response describe recursion instead of
 using the provided callback for nested properties?"

This is flawed because it relies on external, undefined context: "the provided c
allback" (what is it, what does it do, where is it?) and "nested properties" (wh
at are they in this specific context?). It also assumes the evaluator knows the
preferred behavior (using the callback).
Improved (Self-contained): "Does the response correctly use the specified handle
NestedProps callback function to process nested object properties, instead of im
plementing custom recursion logic?"

This version is better because it clarifies:
The name and role of the expected callback (handleNestedProps for processing nes
ted object properties).
The behavior being discouraged (custom recursion logic).
The evaluation context (handling nested properties).
This makes the requirement for self-containment much clearer. I'm ready for the
next part.

Rubrics must follow the no-overlap principle, but this is often violated when mu
ltiple items unintentionally assess the same behavior or concept.

Each rubric should evaluate a clearly distinct and specific aspect of the respon
se. When rubrics overlap (by checking the same logic, function, or outcome) they
 create confusion for evaluators and introduce inconsistency in scoring.

To maintain clarity and accuracy, rubric items must be mutually exclusive. No tw
o rubrics should assess the same feature, even if phrased differently. Instead,
each item should target a unique part of the response, whether that’s a specific
 behavior, a functionality, or a reasoning step.

The goal is to ensure that every rubric adds independent value to the evaluation
 and avoids redundancy.

❌ Example of overlapping rubrics:

Does the response identify file_utils.get_file() as the function handling weight
 caching?

Does the response acknowledge that file_utils.get_file() reuses downloaded weigh
ts to handle network calls?

Explanation: Rubrics #3 and #13 both assess aspects of file_utils.get_file(), ca
using overlap by evaluating its weight and caching functionalities.

I've reviewed the section on the common error of rubrics violating the no-overla
p principle.

I understand that:

Rubrics must be mutually exclusive, meaning each should evaluate a clearly disti
nct and specific aspect of the response.
Overlapping rubrics (checking the same logic, function, outcome, or feature, eve
n if phrased differently) cause confusion and scoring inconsistency.
Each rubric item should target a unique part of the response and add independent
 value, avoiding redundancy.
The example provided is clear:

Rubric 3: "Does the response identify file_utils.get_file() as the function hand
ling weight caching?"
Rubric 13: "Does the response acknowledge that file_utils.get_file() reuses down
loaded weights to handle network calls?"
Explanation of overlap: Both rubrics assess aspects of file_utils.get_file() rel
ated to its weight handling and caching/reuse functionalities. This is an overla
p because they are evaluating very similar (if not the same) core understanding
about that function's role in managing downloaded weights.
This reinforces the need to ensure each rubric item is distinct. I'm ready for t
he next section or the knowledge check.

Rubric Error: Not atomic Rubrics When creating rubrics we often overlook the ato
micity principle and end up writing rubrics that cover multiple unrelated requir
ements.

Each rubric should assess one distinct and logically independent aspect of the r
esponse. It must be focused, narrow in scope, and avoid combining separate check
s into a single item.

That said, it’s acceptable to include multiple checks within the same rubric if
they are functionally tied to evaluating a single coherent behavior (e.g., updat
ing two tightly coupled components to support one feature).

The goal is to ensure clarity and precision and keeping each rubric clean and ta
rgeted, while still allowing for grouped checks when they reflect a unified func
tionality.

❌ Example of not atomic rubrics:

Does the response clarify that DAG and Selector do not communicate with each oth
er, a key reason Facade is a better fit than Mediator?

Does the response differentiate a Simple Factory from the formal, inheritance-ba
sed Factory Method pattern?

Why are these rubrics wrong?

Rubric 5 violates the Atomicity criterion by combining the clarification that DA
G and Selector do not communicate with each other with the reasoning that Facade
 is a better fit than Mediator. Notice that it was already a complete rubric as
“Does the response clarify that DAG and Selector do not communicate with each ot
her? “

Rubric 9 violates Atomicity by addressing both the distinction between a Simple
Factory and the formal Factory Method pattern within a single rubric item.

Rubric Error: Missing Agent Process Rubrics Rubrics tied to Agent processes shou
ld ensure that the model is triggering the correct internal actions when answeri
ng a prompt in Agent mode.

Each rubric should confirm that the right files are being accessed, the relevant
 parameters or code elements are being checked, and no redundant processes are b
eing triggered.

A strong process rubric should:

Target a specific agent behavior (e.g., reading a file, finding a symbol, search
ing for a parameter).

Reflect whether that behavior was necessary and appropriate for the question.

Avoid vague phrasing like "Did the agent try?"—focus on whether the right thing
actually happened or needs to happen.

❌ Example of rubrics with no Agent Processes:

Does the response identify how the @final decorator applied to each visitor clas
s - WrongLoopVisitor, WrongLoopDefinitionVisitor and WrongComprehensionVisitor e
nforces the "Single Responsibility Principle - SRP" by preventing inheritance an
d extension of these classes?

Does the response explicitly identify that the core design pattern implemented a
cross all loop validation visitors (WrongLoopVisitor, WrongLoopDefinitionVisitor
, WrongComprehensionVisitor) is the "Visitor pattern" for AST traversal?

Does the response address how the @decorators.alias implementation specifically
eliminates redundant error handling code by allowing single validation methods t
o cover multiple AST node types- visit_For, visit_While, visit_AsyncFor?

Does the response provide explicit mappings between specific violation classes (
e.g., UselessLoopElseViolation) and the visitor methods that generate them for _
check_loop_needs_else in WrongLoopVisitor?

Does the response detail how the inheritance hierarchy from base.BaseNodeVisitor
 provides fundamental traversal capabilities through its generic_visit() impleme
ntation that all specialized visitors rely on?

Why is this wrong?

None of the five items ask about what actions the model takes (e.g., opening or
scanning @loops.py, locating decorators or methods). They all focus on content i
dentification or explanation, and none on the agent’s process steps.

More Examples of Rubrics Common Errors ❌ Error: Specificity Being too narrowly f
ocused on the PR implementation or one Specific Response Being too specific to a
n actual implementation, like the one in the PR or the one given by the Claude 3
.7 Sonnet response. You can avoid this by mentioning the generalized fix that ne
eds to be made. Remember that an agent may solve the problem using a different s
olution than the one in the Gold Patch, and the rubrics should be flexible enoug
h to allow this.

I have reviewed the provided text on common rubric errors, including:

Not Atomic Rubrics: Rubrics should assess one distinct aspect, unless multiple c
hecks are functionally tied to a single coherent behavior. The examples of combi
ning unrelated facts or distinct concepts in one rubric illustrate this error.
Missing Agent Process Rubrics: Rubrics should also evaluate the agent's internal
 actions (like file access or symbol lookup), not just the final content of the
response. The example of content-only rubrics highlights this.
Specificity (Too Narrow): Rubrics shouldn't be tied to a single specific impleme
ntation (like a PR's exact changes or one model's output) but should allow for d
ifferent valid solutions by focusing on the goal or concept.
Vague Descriptions: Avoid subjective terms like "accurate" or "appropriate" with
out defining the specific criteria. Rubrics should be precise and verifiable.
Atomicity (Re-illustrated): The examples for vague descriptions also show how to
 break down complex requirements into more atomic, testable rubric items.

Cursor question: How does the introduction of the --max-size parameter in @data_
sync.py impact the performance and scalability of the fetch operation in the DVC
 repository, particularly when dealing with large datasets?

Critical Rubrics - Response Successes

Does the response explain the reduced network overhead because of fetching only
smaller files?
Does the response describe the faster fetch operations resulting from skipping l
arge files?
Critical Rubrics - Response Failures

Does the response clarify that the --max-size filtering logic is applied before
downloading any files, using locally available metadata from .dvc files, thereby
 avoiding unnecessary remote access? 4.  Does the response explain that the --ma
x-size filter is applied during traversal of the DAG or stage outputs and whethe
r it disables dependency chains?
Does the response clarify that --max-size applies per file or directory, not tot
al size, affects expectations when handling nested outputs?
Non-Critical Rubrics - Response Successes

Does the response explain the selective data retrieval that is enabled by the --
max-size parameter? 7.  Does the response provide use cases for the --max-size p
arameter, like development environments or partial data analysis?
Non-Critical Rubrics - Response Failures

Does the response provide an example of a real-world workflow or scenario where
--max-size improves efficiency, such as CI pipelines and sampling subsets?
Does the response mention that skipping large files also reduces local disk I/O
and DVC cache usage?
Does the response clarify whether --max-size support different units (e.g. KB, M
B) or only accepts bytes?
Reference Answer:

The introduction of the --max-size parameter in data_sync.py allows users to lim
it the fetch operation to only retrieve files or directories that are below a sp
ecified size (in bytes). This has several implications for performance and scala
bility when dealing with large datasets in a DVC repository:

Performance Impact:
Reduced Network Overhead:
   - By fetching only smaller files, the operation avoids transferring large fil
es, which can significantly reduce network bandwidth usage. This is particularly
 beneficial in environments with limited bandwidth or high latency.

Faster Fetch Operations:
   - Skipping large files means the fetch operation completes faster, as it proc
esses fewer bytes of data. This is especially useful when only a subset of small
er files is needed, and large files can be fetched later or excluded entirely.

Lower Memory Usage:
   - Processing smaller files requires less memory, which can improve the stabil
ity and performance of the fetch operation, especially on systems with limited r
esources.

Scalability Impact:
Selective Data Retrieval:
   - The --max-size parameter enables selective retrieval of data, allowing user
s to prioritize smaller files. This is useful in scenarios where large datasets
are composed of many files of varying sizes, and only a subset is immediately re
quired.

Improved Resource Management:
   - By avoiding the fetch of large files, the system can better manage resource
s (e.g., disk space, CPU, and memory), making the repository more scalable when
dealing with datasets that include very large files.

Flexibility in Workflows:
   - Users can design workflows that fetch smaller files first (e.g., metadata o
r configuration files) and defer the retrieval of larger files (e.g., raw data)
to a later stage or a different process. This modular approach enhances scalabil
ity by breaking down the fetch operation into manageable chunks.

Use Cases:
Development Environments:
  - Developers can fetch only smaller configuration or metadata files during dev
elopment, avoiding the overhead of large datasets until they are explicitly need
ed.

Partial Data Analysis:
  - Data scientists can fetch only the smaller subsets of data required for init
ial analysis, reducing wait times and resource usage.

Edge or Resource-Constrained Environments:
  - In environments with limited storage or bandwidth, the --max-size parameter
ensures that only essential, smaller files are fetched.

Summary:
The --max-size parameter enhances performance by reducing network and memory ove
rhead and improves scalability by enabling selective data retrieval. It is parti
cularly beneficial in scenarios where large datasets are involved, and only a su
bset of smaller files is required.

Answer the following question:

What is the main issue with the task provided in the previous step?
a) There are not enough Response Fails Rubrics.

b)The rubrics are incomplete. There is a Critical Rubric missing for how the cla
ss dynamically determines the base class.

c)Rubric #2 is not self-contained as it is missing the information needed for a
True/False evaluation.

2)What are the main errors in the following rubric? (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY - 2 A
ttempts)

Does the code implement the convert_parameter_to_seconds decorator to ensure the
 duration parameter is always in seconds?

Does the code introduce the _mono_factor_getter function to compute the fadeout
factor for mono audio clips?

Does the code introduce the _stereo_factor_getter function to compute the fadeou

Cursor question: How does the introduction of the --max-size parameter in @data_
sync.py impact the performance and scalability of the fetch operation in the DVC
 repository, particularly when dealing with large datasets?

Critical Rubrics - Response Successes

Does the response explain the reduced network overhead because of fetching only
smaller files?
Does the response describe the faster fetch operations resulting from skipping l
arge files?
Critical Rubrics - Response Failures

Does the response clarify that the --max-size filtering logic is applied before
downloading any files, using locally available metadata from .dvc files, thereby
 avoiding unnecessary remote access?
Does the response explain that the --max-size filter is applied during traversal
 of the DAG or stage outputs and whether it disables dependency chains?
Does the response clarify that --max-size applies per file or directory, not tot
al size, affects expectations when handling nested outputs?
Non-Critical Rubrics - Response Successes

Does the response explain the selective data retrieval that is enabled by the --
max-size parameter?
Does the response provide use cases for the --max-size parameter, like developme
nt environments or partial data analysis?
Non-Critical Rubrics - Response Failures

Does the response provide an example of a real-world workflow or scenario where
--max-size improves efficiency, such as CI pipelines and sampling subsets?
Does the response mention that skipping large files also reduces local disk I/O
and DVC cache usage?
Does the response clarify whether --max-size support different units (e.g. KB, M
B) or only accepts bytes?
Reference Answer:

The introduction of the --max-size parameter in data_sync.py allows users to lim
it the fetch operation to only retrieve files or directories that are below a sp
ecified size (in bytes). This has several implications for performance and scala
bility when dealing with large datasets in a DVC repository:

Performance Impact:
Reduced Network Overhead:

By fetching only smaller files, the operation avoids transferring large files, w
hich can significantly reduce network bandwidth usage. This is particularly bene
ficial in environments with limited bandwidth or high latency.
Faster Fetch Operations:

Skipping large files means the fetch operation completes faster, as it processes
 fewer bytes of data. This is especially useful when only a subset of smaller fi
les is needed, and large files can be fetched later or excluded entirely.
Lower Memory Usage:

Processing smaller files requires less memory, which can improve the stability a
nd performance of the fetch operation, especially on systems with limited resour
ces.
Scalability Impact:
Selective Data Retrieval:

The --max-size parameter enables selective retrieval of data, allowing users to
prioritize smaller files. This is useful in scenarios where large datasets are c
omposed of many files of varying sizes, and only a subset is immediately require
d.
Improved Resource Management:

By avoiding the fetch of large files, the system can better manage resources (e.
g., disk space, CPU, and memory), making the repository more scalable when deali
ng with datasets that include very large files.
Flexibility in Workflows:

Users can design workflows that fetch smaller files first (e.g., metadata or con
figuration files) and defer the retrieval of larger files (e.g., raw data) to a
later stage or a different process. This modular approach enhances scalability b
y breaking down the fetch operation into manageable chunks.
Use Cases:
Development Environments:

Developers can fetch only smaller configuration or metadata files during develop
ment, avoiding the overhead of large datasets until they are explicitly needed.
Partial Data Analysis:

Data scientists can fetch only the smaller subsets of data required for initial
analysis, reducing wait times and resource usage.
Edge or Resource-Constrained Environments:

In environments with limited storage or bandwidth, the --max-size parameter ensu
res that only essential, smaller files are fetched.
Summary:
The --max-size parameter enhances performance by reducing network and memory ove
rhead and improves scalability by enabling selective data retrieval. It is parti
cularly beneficial in scenarios where large datasets are involved, and only a su
bset of smaller files is required.

Cursor Question: When rendering high dimensional plots using PairGrid in @axisgr
id.py , how scalable is the axis-sharing mechanism in terms of memory and plot r
endering time, especially with non-square grids or custom diagonal settings?

Critical Rubrics - Response Successes

Does the response state that memory usage grows (O(n*m)) because PairGrid create
s a full grid of subplots at initialization?
Does the response identify that the axis sharing mechanism is implemented using
the sharex="col" parameter in plt.subplots function to link axes within the same

across linked axes, where a change in one plot triggers updates across its entir
e row and column?

s sharing, diagonal plot handling, or the loop where axes are removed for corner

ecified in the prompt, seaborn/axisgrid.py?

ng Python's timeit or memory_profiler modules?

, which moves beyond a general statement to explain that joining the y-axes of a
ll diagonal plots affects rendering as the number of variables increases?

tion about scalability by explaining that it reduces computational and memory ov
erhead by eliminating half the subplots in high-dimensional plots?
Does the response indicate that the agent's process log show a workflow that avo
ids redundancy, such as reading the exact same file (Seaborn/seaborn/axisgrid.py

Reference Answer:

I'll analyze how PairGrid handles axis-sharing for high-dimensional plots, focus
ing on memory usage and rendering time.

Looking more closely at the PairGrid implementation to understand its axis shari
ng behavior:

I'll look for more details about diagonal axis sharing:

Read file: Seaborn/seaborn/axisgrid.py

Based on the code review, I can provide a detailed analysis of the scalability o
f PairGrid's axis-sharing mechanism for high-dimensional plots.

The PairGrid class uses Matplotlib's built-in axis sharing through the sharex="c
ol" and sharey="row" parameters when creating the subplot grid. This has implica
tions for both memory usage and rendering time:

Memory Usage
Subplot Creation & Memory Overhead:
   - The code creates a full grid of subplots (n×n for n variables) using plt.su
bplots(), which allocates memory for all axes objects regardless of whether they
'll be used.

   - When using corner=True, axes in the upper triangle are removed with axes[i,
 j].remove(), but this happens after they've been initially created and memory a
llocated.

   - The comment on lines 1187-1190 explicitly acknowledges this: "setting up th
e axes is usually the most time-intensive part of using the PairGrid. We are for
egoing the speed improvement that we would get by just not setting up the hidden
 axes..."

Non-Square Grids:
   - For non-square grids (when x_vars ≠ y_vars), a grid of size len(y_vars) × l
en(x_vars) is created.

   - This means the memory usage grows as O(n×m) where n and m are the number of
 variables on each axis.

Diagonal Plot Overhead:
   - When using map_diag(), PairGrid creates additional axes for diagonal plots
using ax.twinx(), which creates twin axes sharing the same x-axis.

   - Each diagonal plot essentially has two axes objects: the original one and t
he twinned one.

Rendering Time
Shared Axes Mechanism:
   - Matplotlib's axis sharing links axes objects so they update together, which
 means:

     - When one axis in a column is updated, all axes in that column need to upd
ate (due to sharex="col")

     - When one axis in a row is updated, all axes in that row need to update (d
ue to sharey="row")

   - This creates an O(n) dependency for each axis update, meaning the rendering
 time can grow quadratically as the number of variables increases.

Diagonal Axis Sharing:
   - The diagonal axes have their own sharing mechanism (lines 1365-1369) using
get_shared_y_axes().join() when diag_sharey=True.

   - This means all diagonal plots will synchronize their y-axes, adding another
 layer of update propagation during rendering.

Corner Plot Optimization:
   - When corner=True, PairGrid removes axes in the upper triangle, reducing the
 total number of plots to render by approximately half.

   - This can significantly improve rendering performance for large grids, thoug
h the initial setup cost remains.

Scalability Limitations
High-Dimensional Challenges:
   - For very high-dimensional data (e.g., 20+ variables), the quadratic growth
in both memory usage and rendering time becomes a significant bottleneck.

   - The code creates n² subplot axes initially, even if some are later removed.

Axis Synchronization Overhead:
   - As dimensions increase, the cascading updates from axis synchronization bec
ome increasingly expensive.

   - Each pan/zoom operation triggers updates across entire rows and columns.

Diagonal Plot Trade-offs:
   - The diag_sharey parameter controls whether diagonal plots share y-axes, whi
ch affects rendering performance.

   - Setting this to False can improve performance at the cost of potentially in
consistent scaling across diagonal plots.

Practical Considerations
Memory-Performance Trade-off:
   - The comment on lines 1187-1190 mentions that a more optimized implementatio
n could avoid creating unused axes, but this would require reimplementing plt.su
bplots(), which they decided against for simplicity.

Non-Square Grid Efficiency:
   - For exploratory analysis, using non-square grids (different sets of variabl
es on x and y axes) can be more efficient when you only care about specific vari
able relationships.

Render-Time Optimization:
   - Using corner=True can significantly improve rendering performance while sti
ll showing the important relationships.

   - Setting diag_sharey=False can also improve performance by reducing synchron
ized updates.

To summarize, PairGrid's axis-sharing mechanism is efficient for small to medium
-sized variable sets (roughly 2-15 variables), but it faces scalability challeng
es with higher dimensions due to its quadratic growth in both memory usage and r
endering time. The implementation prioritizes simplicity and integration with Ma
tplotlib over optimization for very high-dimensional data.

Question 6: What is the previous task failing at a)Rubrics #4 and #6 are overlap
ping in the examples requested b)There is a Critical Rubric missing on the non-s
quare grids mentioned in the prompt c)Rubric #7 is not self-contained. d)Rubrics
