### **Final, Exhaustive, and Meticulously Justified Evaluation Report**

This report provides an exhaustive, point-by-point analysis of the entire Antechamber task, justifying every component of every turn—both correct and incorrect—against the project instructions and all possible error types, in the requested format.

---

**Question 1: Are there errors in the System Prompt?**

*   **Answer:** Yes.
*   **Exhaustive Justification:** The prompt fails on Step 5 (Coherence) because it contains a direct contradiction: the narrative text states `location services` are **off**, while the `DEVICE SETTINGS` JSON block states `"location_service": true`. A model cannot follow conflicting instructions. However, the prompt correctly implements all other requirements:
    *   **Steps 1-4, 6-8 (PASS):** The prompt successfully defines the role, uses all 5 building blocks, applies all necessary complexity principles, passes the banlist check, and includes safety/scaling rules, adhering to the "Crafting the System Prompt" guide.

**Question 2: Are there errors in the Tool Calls across the conversation?**

*   **Answer:** Yes.
*   **Exhaustive Justification:**
    *   **Turn 1 - `weather_forecast` (FAIL):**
        *   `wrong_tool_selected`: **No Issue.** `weather_forecast` is the correct tool.
        *   `no_tool_triggered` / `tool_over_triggered`: **No Issue.** A tool call was appropriate.
        *   `wrong_param_value`: **Major Issue.** The `latlng` parameter was hallucinated. The model must use the location from the system prompt as per the "Context Information" rule.
        *   All other parameter errors: **No Issue.**
    *   **Turn 2 - `search_yelp` (PASS):**
        *   **No Errors.** The tool choice is correct per the system prompt ("prioritize searching on Yelp"). All parameters are correct and use context appropriately. No tool call errors apply.
    *   **Turn 3 - `product_search` (FAIL):**
        *   `parallel_calls_missing`: **Major Issue.** The user requested products AND reviews. The "Advanced Conversation Structures" guide requires parallel calls for independent requests. The model failed to also call `product_reviews`.
        *   All other tool call errors: **No Issue.**
    *   **Turn 5 - `seller_profile` (FAIL):**
        *   `wrong_param_value`: **Major Issue.** The model hallucinated the `seller_id` as `"Ernie Ball"`. The "Guiding Principles" forbid hallucination. The model must use tools to gather information, not invent it.
    *   **Turn 6 - `search_events` (PASS):**
        *   **No Errors.** The tool choice and all parameters are correct. No tool call errors apply.

**Question 3: Are there errors in the Text Responses (Summaries) across the conversation?**

*   **Answer:** Yes.
*   **Exhaustive Justification:**
    *   **Turn 2 - Steakhouse List (FAIL):**
        *   **Formatting Violation:** The response uses **three** bullet points, violating the explicit system prompt rule of "a maximum of 2 bullet points."
        *   **`unsatisfactory_summary`:** The content is **ungrounded**. The `tool_response` was a `katex-error`. The model invented the entire list, violating the rule that information must be "aligned with the JSON the tool_response returned."
    *   **Turn 4 - Ernie Ball Details (FAIL):**
        *   **`unsatisfactory_summary`:** The summary is **ungrounded**. The `tool_response` was a `KeyError`. The model hallucinated positive editorial content instead of reporting the failure.
    *   **All other Text Responses (PASS):** The other text responses correctly summarize the data from their preceding tool calls and adhere to the persona and formatting rules.

**Question 4: Are there errors at the overall Task Level?**

*   **Answer:** Yes.
*   **Exhaustive Justification:** The task fails to meet the mandatory category requirements. The instructions state: "**! \* You MUST cover all specified task categories given in a task.**" The task specifications required `[Feasible Tool Use]`, `[Infeasible Tool Use]`, and `[Natural User]`. The conversation **completely omits an `Infeasible Tool Use` scenario**, which is a critical structural failure. All other task-level requirements were met.
